    "Complexity Enhancement",
    "The availability of non-internationally controlled substances has stabilized, but there is an increase in the number of new types of opioids with potential for harm, and the drug market is becoming more complex.",

    "There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic market of member countries every year.",
    "at present , most are stimulants , followed by synthetic cannabinoid agonists and small amounts of opioids .",
    "Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized , the proportion of substances has changed .",

    "Many of the new psychoactive substances that are fentanyl analogues have been shown to be effective and dangerous , causing overdose deaths in North America and elsewhere , albeit to a lesser extent .",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs ( including cocaine and methamphetamine ) and as a component in counterfeit prescription opioids .",
    "evidence of injection of new psychoactive substances of abuse in Europe has emerged : a study of waste @-@ syringe @-@ remnants in six European cities found that many syringes contained new psychoactive substances of abuse that produced stimulant effects .",
    "the use of novel psychoactive substances is likely to become entrenched in vulnerable populations over time .",

    "in other countries , the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation .",
    "the use of opioids for pain management and palliative care is unevenly distributed across regions , with the therapeutic opioids primarily available in high @-@ income countries .",
    "in 2018 , more than 90 % of all opioids available for medical consumption were in high @-@ income countries .",
    "About 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.",

    "poorer people are at greater risk of developing the disease , which affects an estimated 35.6 million people worldwide .",
    "poverty , limited education , and social marginalization may increase the risk of and exacerbate the consequences of drug use disorders . This has been confirmed in studies in high @-@ income countries , where the social @-@ economic trajectory of individuals is associated not only with their status at a given point in time but also with the risk of drug use disorders .",
    "the social and economic disadvantages associated with addiction are compounded by the risk of unemployment , poverty , and homelessness , which in turn perpetuate the cycle of disadvantage . These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system .",
    "women , ethnic and migrant minorities , sexual and gender diverse groups , people displaced by armed conflict or disasters , and people living in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug @-@ related illnesses or face problems accessing treatment services .",

    "the relationship between drugs and violence is complex , and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychostimulants and violence .",
    "limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicides .",
    "But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a larger role than drugs.",
    "Although drug use may lead to criminal behavior , in some cases , this association can be partially attributed to multiple mediators , such as socioeconomic disadvantage , and other types of adversity , such as those influenced by individual risk , family environment , and peers .",
    "The connection between drug dealing and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence.",
    "In the short term, the existence and intensity of violence are more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.",
    "Latest Trends",
    "Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most dangerous.",
    "An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.",
    "By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "but the associated harms of opioids are often overlooked because they are less commonly used .",
    "of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use in 2017 , 66 % were caused by these substances , and 50 % of the estimated 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death attributable to drug use were caused by these substances .",
    "Synthetic opioid misuse exacerbates public health crisis",
    "in West Africa , Central Africa , and North Africa , ketamine is the drug of choice for exacerbating the opioid crisis ; in North America , it is fentanyl . The two regions have almost nothing in common in terms of economic , demographic , or general drug use patterns , but they are both struggling with the opioid crisis , which is fueled by the availability and low cost of production of these substances .",
    "in North America , the use of synthetic opioids , including fentanyl , has led to a 20 @-@ year increase in opioid overdose deaths .",
    "In 2018, two thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths in the United States involved fentanyl.",
    "a similar result was reported in canada , but with lower numbers .",
    "part of the reason for the overdose deaths is the unpredictable effects of the fentanyl in the illicit drug market .",
    "In West Africa , Central Africa , and North Africa , the market for nonmedical use of khat has grown substantially .",
    "in the region , more and more Qomad\u014ds are being treated for the disease .",
    "In 2017, the global seizure of cocaine increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating ketamine, global seizures dropped to 32 tons.",
    "The crisis in both places was fueled by the manufacture of simple and cheap products, and by the lack of international regulation of ketamine and many other opioids.",
    "The crisis in both places is compounded by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and the illicit markets, making it difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.",
    "Use of stimulants continues to rise",
    "The cocaine and methamphetamine markets are the largest in the stimulant field, and both substances are increasing in use in their primary markets.",
    "About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.",
    "an estimated 27 million people used amphetamines in 2016 , with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America .",
    "based on the majority of indicators , methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for the past 20 years .",
    "in some markets , cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes substitute for each other , with the use of one drug rising as the use of the other falls and sometimes both increasing and decreasing to meet the same market demand .",
    "COVID @-@ 19 increases risk for injecting drug users",
    "an estimated 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 , and about 10 % of global HIV infections were attributed to injecting drug use .",
    "More than 1 million injection drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug overdoses, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which is still largely untreated among people who inject drugs.",
    "the shortage of opioids caused by COVID @-@ 19 restrictions may lead to users substituting with more readily available substances , such as alcohol or benzodiazepines , or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs .",

    "The fitness club member protection storm is a deep-seated problem of industry trust crisis.",

A real estate project in the Jiangbei New Area claimed \u201cprice compensation\u201d, and the discount of other real estate resources was greater than the previous discount",

    "Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this was actually a \u201cprice maintenance agreement\u201d. The purpose was to reassure the buyer that he did not have to worry about the developer\u2019s price reduction promotion. \u201cNow I\u2019m afraid that after buying it, it will be reduced in price, and I will have no time to go to the sales office to make trouble.

    "However, more than two months have passed, and the online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%, of which 8 units in total, 128 units, accounting for 113 units, and 44 units of 124 units in 7 units have not been sold, and the total number of transactions in the project is only 33 units",
    "Market insiders said that the \"price maintenance agreement\" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.",
    "In August of that year, the apartment project Lugu West Garden on Huangshan Road in Hexi District launched a \u201cprice guarantee plan\u201d to attract buyers. The specific content was that \u201cthe company solemnly promises that if the project\u2019s discount range is expanded within one year, the company will return the difference to the old owners according to the difference\u201d.",
    "After that, in April 2011, nine projects in Nanjing also promised to pay the difference in price for a portion of their properties.",

    "He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has already transitioned from \u201cconsumer accessibility\u201d to \u201cconsumer quality\u201d, and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the \u201chard currency\u201d of the e-commerce industry.",
    "At the same time, content has become the fundamental and handle of the new stage of e-commerce development. Knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content have begun to become the standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.",
    "Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Qiu Guoming put forward two suggestions.",
    "One is to promote the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecology from the perspective of improving the content structure, creating positive content creation and management standards, and realizing the dynamic balance of the system index of the e-commerce content ecology.",
    "Another is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value coordination and joint creation of the external environment.",
    "\u201cIn the future, the e-commerce industry still needs more data and artificial intelligence support to form a stable prediction for future development; in addition, provide more regulated and healthy growth space for merchants, realize the value of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and jointly create a healthy content ecosystem.",

With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI leading indicators, the US CPI data has turned to the phase of rapid decline since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a basis for future inflation data.

    "A Chinese spy balloon drifted over the United States for days before it was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday.",
    "The Pentagon said the second object shot down entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.",
    "The Pentagon also said there was no indication that the object was maneuverable.",

    "The official description of the object from the US authorities can be roughly summarized as follows: the size is about that of a small car, it has no joystick, no suspension, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.",
    "But this information does not answer the basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what its mission is.",

    "As you read this book, you may recall the fights you've had with your spouse, the acquaintances you know who are in loveless marriages, and the relationships that just aren't working.",
    "This is why I don't recommend reading it, aesthetically speaking, the writing and plot are bland, unless your life is a rollercoaster or a candy castle, you'll feel like you're reading something that's not weird or boring.",
    "And, in terms of depth of thought, the everyday scenarios are not particularly illuminating or expansive (unlike Malcolm's \"The Age of Innocence\"), and the brief snippets of conversation don't address any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to failed relationships.",
    "What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?",
    "So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't matter much.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and form than story, which is why the reading experience is less than ideal.",
    "It is suitable for rough reading, but not for detailed reading.",
    "The book is well-logical, but not enough content.",
    "It explains what and why many sales theories, but it is weak in how to do it, it only points out the direction but does not give specific practice.",
    "Also, the book feels like it was pieced together.",
    "For example, there are both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.",
    "I don't know if it's a story written for the sake of example, and if it's more convincing if some cases are written by the author.",
    "The terms \"customer\" and \"client\" have been used interchangeably.",
    "The title is still the customer, but the main text has become the customer.",
    "The eBook also had problems with misspellings, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering.",
    "In summary, this book is a good choice as an introduction to the theory, but it is not suitable for people who have already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.",
    "A Quick Guide to Internet Finance",
    "This book is shallow, it can be said that it is only an introduction, and it can help you quickly understand the overall situation of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig it yourself.",
    "And the book was written earlier, and the later WeChat Pay subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not yet been mentioned, and the current share of third party payments is probably not as small as the proportion mentioned in the book.",
    "Now many people take their mobile phones with them when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank flow.",
    "But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introduction book, which shows that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the financial development history at home and abroad, so it can write such popular and easy-to-understand content.",
    "It is easy to write high and lofty, but difficult to write simple and easy to understand.",
    "I appreciate you, and I want you to know!",
    "The first factor in determining job satisfaction is not the level of pay, but whether the employee is given enough respect and recognition for the work they do.",
    "According to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, after the basic survival needs of human beings are satisfied, the most urgent is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the hope of being understood, recognized and appreciated.",
    "Indeed, for the Chinese people, most of them are \u201chard to say I love you\u201d in their mouths, even if they have love, gratitude and praise, they will keep it in their hearts and not say it out loud.",
    "In this book, the author explains five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, and physical touch.",
    "I think the important thing is not to know what the five languages of appreciation are, but to be able to use them at any time, anywhere, to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.",
    "In fact, the more intimate people are, the more they need praise and gratitude, so that our lives will become more beautiful.",
    "Learning to praise can also help companies retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.",
    "I would like to thank the translators for bringing us the wonderful foreign ideas and the world.",
    "Due to the differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there are differences between the two languages, and if you have the opportunity to see the original version, I believe you will gain more.",
    "Thanks again to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!",
    "Amazon, please check this product carefully.",
    "The quality is terrible, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and even worse than the products on the roadside stall. There is no weight, no code, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose and loose, which is not the feature of qualified products at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is completely a problem of quality; I recommend that the seller wipe his eyes and refuse",
    "I hope Amazon can be strict with the source of goods.",
    "The product is mediocre and does not meet expectations.",
    "Pros:",
    "1. Big brand, cheap price.",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is also OK to use, but it is not as good as I expected.",
    "Disadvantages:",
    "1. No indicator light for charging, the most basic indicator light for your power is missing, and I estimate that customers who buy products for 300 yuan are also a waste and have no respect.",
    "2. Strong odor. When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of burning plastic.",
    "I tried it in my office for a day and it smelled like plastic all over the place.",
    "Compared with the same priced Philips PHILIPS I used before, although it has more blades, the quality of this Panasonic product is really not worthy of consumers.",
    "small package.",
    "I received the parcel and saw that it was written as the e-commerce version. I knew that I had been cheated again. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be M. It was not the same as the picture on the product introduction. It was the new version.",
    "The three stars are because you are careless and did not see the specifications of the goods. I have no opinion on the fact that you sell the M code version of the merchant. What do you mean by \u201cthe goods are not the right version\u201d?",
    "The e-commerce tricks are deep, and I still go to the supermarket to buy it.",
    "I'm just a little bit of a mess.",
    "I don't like the taste.",
    "The kid doesn't like the taste of toothpaste, saying it's spicy every time, which is probably not the best word to describe it, but it's the only word in the kid's vocabulary at the moment.",
    "I bought it when I was organizing the event, so it was cheap, so I didn\u2019t dare to give it a bad review, so I gave it four stars, but I won\u2019t buy it again.",
    "original packaging",
    "The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag inside, and there are no online reviews except for the appearance of a single product.",
    "The plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle was also like the one described in the picture, and the delivery was also very fast, and the second day's delivery arrived.",
    "It is genuine, but there is no stock, and I don\u2019t know when it will be re-listed.",
    "A bad shopping experience",
    "I placed an order on the 5th of November, but the package was never delivered. After checking, I found out that the package had already been signed for, but none of my colleagues had signed for it. I contacted the courier company, but they said that they could only initiate an inquiry after the package had been sent. I contacted Amazon customer service, and I had to wait more than ten days before I finally found out that the package had been delivered to",
    "Wrong picture.",
    "I thought I could get the headphones like the picture 1, but I got the headphones like the picture 2, the inconsistency of the picture is okay, but what does it mean that the left and right headphones have different sound volume?",
    "Although the name is the same, I hope everyone can pay attention, and I also ask the responsible person of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time, thank you very much.",
    "the operating system is generally",
    "It took a while, but overall the picture is still good, you don\u2019t feel any difference, but this system is confusing to look at, the boot time is noticeably slow, and you can\u2019t do a good setup, and the software that comes with it is not worth commenting on, the response speed is just average, and it\u2019s not even a number compared to my colleague\u2019s.",
    "I read the reviews saying it was very humanized design, I didn't find where it was humanized, the remote control is the usual up, down, left, right, back design, the location is really not flattering.",
    "So, just be a TV, plus a TV box.",
    "The price is too good to be true.",
    "The price is too good, from 100 to 99!",
    "I had a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I just used a copy of a sentence as the rating content.",
    "If I were to rate this product, I would say it is at least 85 out of 100.",
    "And for the poor products, I absolutely will not be lazy to copy and paste the evaluation, so that other consumers can refer to it when buying, and the seller will also improve the quality of the goods.",
    "Low price, good line, no fever, that's enough!",
    "This is such a cheap line, but it should have reached the HDMI certification standard. Compared with the dog things (prices are twice as expensive) in the domestic Akihabara, the line is thick and soft, and the 7m transmission is without noise. In the future, I will accept the low-priced line of BES!",
    "It's still good but Amazon's customer service is really bad compared to other websites",
    "I placed an order and realized I made a mistake, but I can\u2019t cancel the order, the website link to online customer service always shows an error link, and I can\u2019t contact them.",
    "After the delivery, the delivery man called me, I said I didn\u2019t want it, I wanted to cancel the order, but I couldn\u2019t cancel it, and the delivery man took it back, saying to sign it first, and then I could apply for a return.",
    "When I asked for a return, I was told that once the food was signed for, it could not be returned, and I could not call Amazon customer service, which said the same thing: once signed for, it could not be returned.",
    "I have bought non-returnable items before on JD and Sunning, including milk and underwear, and contacted customer service to return them, and they returned them, and the underwear from JD was too big when I opened it, so I contacted customer service and they returned it, but it didn\u2019t work on Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, people are alive, how to deal with your customer service?",
    "Tell me whether I should buy it myself or let the delivery person buy it, it\u2019s not easy for the delivery person to buy it, why should I let the delivery person buy something that is not bought by myself?",
    "okay, I won't back out, I'll take it myself, but I have to give you a 1-star service",
    "Don't waste your money.",
    "First of all, I was looking forward to buying, I thought that the Dali brand should not be bad, but when I received it, I thought that the packaging was still good, the size was not bad, but one box was basically soft, it was not visible from the outside, you need to feel it, it has no taste at all, it is tasteless, and when you bite it, the fruit is yellowish and it is bad, you can see",
    "I have learned a lot, and I will never buy fruits from e-commerce again!",
    "Where is the anti-counterfeiting label of the product?",
    "The corner of the bottle is recessed, which should be caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, the degree of being pursued is heartbreaking, after all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is still an international purchase, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeit mark, and it is very easy to open the bottle, the key is that the layer of honey inside is directly blown out, there is almost",
    "I was born in China, so I don\u2019t understand.",
    "It should be genuine, right?",
    "Also, when I took the picture, it said 20s, and this is 14s, I bought it abroad for the first time, and I just wrote my doubts down, maybe it\u2019s all normal?",
    "The delivery service needs to be improved.",
    "I bought 5 vouchers, and when I extracted them, I made an appointment to extract 3 for the first time, and only 2 were sent, and after communicating with many people, it was confirmed that they were not sent, and they promised to send them after the appointment; for the second appointment, I just caught up with the rest day, and neither the website nor WeChat reminded me that I needed to make an appointment on a working day, which",
    "Nice shopping.",
    "The goods are good!",
    "I still believe in Amazon\u2019s self-owned things. Now it\u2019s convenient to buy abroad. The logistics time from abroad is only a few days longer than that of the domestic. I have to say that Amazon\u2019s ability to clear customs from abroad is still very strong. It is much faster than transferring. So now many things are bought abroad.",
    "I hope the quality and price of domestic goods will be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to go out and buy them back than to buy them in China, and I hope it will be improved.",
    "trash.",
    "When you see a package like this, do you think it's garbage?",
    "A plastic-packed package, a plastic bag from Germany, is that responsible?",
    "I think this packaging is like garbage, buy this product, packaging and its primitive, no measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after receiving it, the package has completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.",
    "If I just ran into one of these, I knew, bought a few of these, reached out to Amazon customer service, they said they could return, but shipping fees would be paid by me, and then the shipping fees would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I asked, I paid the shipping fee with cash, you gave me a gift card, it's like you want me to buy your gift card, and then you want me to mail the product to your warehouse in Germany, it's like I'm buying the product and then I'm the one who's suffering!",
    "I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for this problem, but the customer service is not willing to take responsibility even for half a sentence, so what guarantee does this after-sales service have? One sentence: I\u2019m sorry! But I estimate that I will not be given the opportunity to publish this evaluation, and I will directly delete it!",
    "Quality is good 5 stars, logistics is bad",
    "1, Quality is good, kills in seconds, price is reasonable, worth the money.",
    "2, solid, enough material, welding points firm, surface treatment is appropriate, color is good.",
    "3, logistics is a hard injury, the order of number 3 was delivered on the 11th.",
    "4. If Amazon had marked the estimated delivery date as February 7, I might have been satisfied.",
    "5, but if you note the expected delivery time, it is equivalent to a commitment to the user, and when the commitment cannot be fulfilled, the user is very difficult to bear.",
    "6. If you don\u2019t have the commitment, don\u2019t make the commitment.",
    "7, actually, I care a lot about the commitment of the seller.",
    "8, so I got a low score.",
    "The gold line will fade.",
    "The effect is still there, but whether it is obvious or not depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.",
    "The only thing that is not good is the gold line. It was designed to look good, but in fact, the gold line will fall off, and if you put it on the car, you will find that there is some gold powder on your hand and the car.",
    "I hope the product can be improved.",
    "This rectangular one has no decoration effect, so don\u2019t put gold lines on it, and it will fall off and dirty the car, which is troublesome.",
    "The goods are fine, the speed is good, and the two packages are different packaging.",
    "The speed of 8 days is fast, but only 2 packages were separated, and the packaging is different, obviously one is too shockproof, thick paperboard is pasted, layered plastic is sealed, and the outer packaging is also easy to disassemble, like a domestic express box, a few buffer airbags are put in, and it\u2019s done, and it feels a little sloppy.",
    "The yalan mattress is really good.",
    "The mattress of 34CM is not as thick as the ordinary one, and you don\u2019t need to sleep on the mattress directly.",
    "Quality is good, both sides are soft, sleep is comfortable, I fell asleep quickly after lying on it.",
    "The mattress was delivered and there were some stains on it due to the violent delivery, but the customer service at Yalan was responsible and efficient in solving the problem.",
    "Amazon is not a retailer, it is a scam",
    "The page clearly indicates that it is self-owned, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, and after-sales service is responsible by the supplier, and the problem is contacted by the supplier.",
    "I want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier, and it cannot be canceled; I want to return the goods, I have successfully applied for return and exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one will help you, you need to contact the supplier yourself to return the goods.",
    "This Nima sells its own products.",
    "The goods are not Amazon delivery, after-sales Amazon does not bear, the customer service said \"I will contact the supplier for you\", and claimed to be self-owned, it is too shameful, it is nakedly not face, it is nakedly cheating consumers!",
    "the experience of boredom",
    "The filter cartridges I bought from other online stores were not bad, and the filter effect was good, and even after 28 days, I used it for another day or two, and there was no water scale.",
    "Since the quality of the things I bought on Amazon has always been good, I thought I would buy it here this time. This is the first time I bought a filter on Amazon, and I don't feel good. Not only did it start to have water stains early, but the filter also had floating black carbon powder after using it for 28 days. I don't know if I should continue using it or throw it away. It's really depressing.",
    "it's not as good as you'd imagine.",
    "Compared to the plug-in board I used before, the external workmanship is general, and how the internal is not opened, but I hope it is as described by the store, whether each independent unit is powered is lack of display",
    "The packaging was damaged, and I waited for the time to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer packaging is pretty beat up, the inner box looks new but the instruction booklet looks like it's not new, it was just renovated in September, it's in stock, I hope it's not bad when it arrives, please explain why a few customers mentioned the packaging was beat up and you guys are still selling it, thanks!",
    "Overall good, a few issues",
    "I bought a water filter pitcher for the first time, and after reading several reviews, I felt that LAICA was a good value, so I chose it. When I received the goods, I installed the filter according to the instructions, and I tried it out, and I felt that it was generally good, but when I poured water, it seemed that the original water would mix with the treated water (the original water tank was not sealed tightly).",
    "When using, you must wait for all the water to pass through the filter before pouring it out!",
    "the picture is incomplete.",
    "The picture does not show the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is one; this bead is made in Thailand, but it is not marked with the place of origin, this is two; there is no mark of quality, this is three; when I bought it in the UK, each item was clearly in a box, but here there is only one simple plastic bag, and",
    "Be careful when buying, especially if you are buying from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is great.",
    "I ordered two days ago and today I found out that the price was reduced by 40 yuan, and I spent a lot of time looking for customer service, and the customer service said that they could not make up the price difference, but they could reorder and return the goods.",
    "This kind of customer experience and service is really different from that of Tao Tao.",
    "It's okay, as a newbie, it's worth buying",
    "It looks good, and it\u2019s not inferior to the ultra-premium gold, which I\u2019ve seen in the mall and costs several hundred yuan. This is the first time I\u2019ve played with gold, and it\u2019s okay.",
    "it's not bad.",
    "The stuff is really good, I bought it for my girlfriend. However, I was a little unhappy when I found out that the delivery person didn\u2019t leave a message when I wasn\u2019t at home. The delivery company just left the package in the mailbox and didn\u2019t send me a confirmation message that the package was delivered. I had to go to the post office twice to get the package.",
    "But the baby is really good.",
    "Worth the purchase",
    "The monkey is cute, the Amazon discount is really big, the Zhi Sheng Sheng official website directly sends the goods, I ordered it last night, and I received it this afternoon, it\u2019s really fast.",
    "The postman is also responsible.",
    "I agree!",
    "A customer's confession",
    "1. When you receive such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you within 54 hours.",
    "2 Then in the middle you contact the customer service, they will tell you that this problem will be handled by the specialist, he will tell you the result.",
    "You never initiated contact with this agent, you never knew her extension, you never had a direct line to her, it was always her contacting you.",
    "Tragically, I waited nearly three days and the commissioner contacted me, and I left my phone for a while and did not receive the commissioner's call.",
    "I waited for 2 hours and the agent never called me, so I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed them to ask them to call me back.",
    "4 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do with the coffee machine that I received as a defective product!",
    "5. There is no problem with Amazon\u2019s products in the US, and shopping overseas is a good way to shop, but the service is far worse than that of Amazon and Alibaba.",
    "6 for me, I can only wait ...",
    "the bottom is not flat",
    "Because the review said it was good, I was looking forward to it, and I liked it when I got it, it was light, but when I opened it, I found a problem, the bottom was not flat, it was raised in the middle and sunk around the edges, and the oil ran to the edges, and the special large pork chop I bought to open the pot was not covered by the oil, and it was a mess, I couldn\u2019t open the pot",
    "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just unlucky, but I just got a bottomless pan that\u2019s not flat, and thankfully Amazon offers a month of returns, so I decided to return it.",
    "I wiped the pot clean and washed it, and I was busy for half a day.",
    "Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to realize",
    "It's a very minimalist design.",
    "The square shape is designed with a slight curve on the top.",
    "It should be a very smooth line.",
    "Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.",
    "Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water tank cover.",
    "The top cover's arc and the control panel's arc are not consistent, and there is a difference of up to 2mm after the two are combined.",
    "It looks like a small gap.",
    "But it does destroy the entire design aesthetic.",
    "I feel a little sorry for the product designer.",
    "It seems that the product managers of Meitu are not capable of creating products of such a high standard.",
    "(Of course, the feedback for the after-sales lady cannot be too high, but when I heard the after-sales say that all the individuals of this product are like this, it is not only the problem of the one I bought, her nonchalant and responsible mood made me understand that the beauty cannot be too high) 2019-7-7 Pump failure, low water output, and it has been repaired for the second time,",
    "After the discount, it is worth it, and the Amazon fake discount is heartbreaking.",
    "Baby born a week ago, very strong insulation.",
    "The outside of the pot is cold to the touch, so it can effectively protect the temperature from being lost.",
    "The air conditioning was still on in the room the next morning.",
    "Amazon said that the 320 offers were the best of the year, but later found that everyone had 249, 289, and 299, and suddenly felt cheated, but when I went to the store, I still found that it was cheaper than various brands, and I could take it with me when I went out in the future.",
    "Vitamix 6300",
    "I have been waiting for a long time, and I saw that the price of Mia 6300 was discounted, and the price of the Central Asia overseas purchase was the same, so I quickly bought it.",
    "I placed an order on September 2nd, and the estimated delivery date was September 21st. However, the goods arrived on September 12th, which was about 10 days earlier than expected. The speed was really fast!",
    "The packaging box is not big, and the original packaging of Vitamix is used directly, and Amazon is not afraid that it will be broken after being thrown across the ocean!",
    "The machine looks new and complete, and the fact that the cup is shaking on the base is impressive, I\u2019m afraid to turn it on and the cup will fly out!",
    "I asked a friend who has 5200 and he described it as not as loose as mine.",
    "The recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn\u2019t find the Chinese version online, which is a pain!",
    "I received the package and immediately bought a transformer, I estimated that it would take 3 days to arrive, and I would have to wait until then to make a good deal!",
    "It's too small, no parachute, and the material is not good.",
    "It's not a big bell at all!",
    "Second Totes, 1. This one has no umbrella cover 2. The handle material is generally 3. It is written Large, but in fact it is a convenient umbrella for one person, and two people are estimated to be enough.",
    "On the contrary, the one I bought from Meiya before can be used by three people without pressure.",
    "I don't feel good.",
    "First of all, the box is not very solid, it deforms with a single tap, secondly, the design of the back prevents the ABS from being scratched when placed flat, and it does not work, and thirdly, the box is a piece of cloth wrapped around a rod, which is emphasized... and so on, various dissatisfaction, and finally the lace is a bit uncomfortable.",
    "PS: The wheel feels really good.",
    "and you can still do it.",
    "Pros: This shoulder bag is more refined and durable.",
    "Cons: The QR code on the card can\u2019t be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6 inch laptop won\u2019t fit (not long enough), the shoulder strap can be locked, but the seller didn\u2019t provide a lock, so it\u2019s not very customer-friendly.",
    "overall it's okay, don't know if it's genuine leather",
    "The overall feeling is okay, but I don't know if it's genuine leather, so I can't judge it.",
    "It can hold A4 size documents, and it can hold 80 pages thick, but too thick and hard boxed objects (not deformable) it can't hold.",
    "The package is soft, and the inner bag is also more humanized, which is still pretty good.",
    "It's just that the bottom I got has a small sand pit, I don't know if it's because my character is not good or what?",
    "I was too lazy to go back and forth to exchange the goods, so I endured it.",
    "Overall, it's worth four stars.",
    "ForRoyal is a global sensation, camera straps for DSLR",
    "The shoulder strap is well designed, practical and comfortable, and the camera is fixed and protected by a soft material on the chest, unlike other quick-shooters, which fix the camera to the bottom with screws, and it is also very easy to take off the camera.",
    "Garbage after-sales service",
    "I bought a guitar a month and a half ago, and it was missing a part. I notified Amazon and they gave me a phone number for customer service. After several communications, the part still hasn\u2019t arrived. What kind of efficiency is that?",
    "I estimate that the problem maintenance will be more troublesome, and I hope that friends who are good at after-sales service will still take a detour, it is too troublesome!",
    "it has some small flaws, but the sound is good.",
    "The headstock has a flaw, missing a corner, feels like a reject, no extras, but for the price it's not bad, the sound of the guitar is not bad.",
    "it's okay, the first menu",
    "I used it for a long time, except for the low frequency, it is generally not bad.",

    "Amazon can't find the place to complain.",

    "The label adhesive is too poor, and it is not waterproof.",
    "Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the content printed is not waterproof, and the surface is not covered with a film; and the label adhesive is poor, it is not suitable for cable labeling at all, and it is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy it to organize cables need to pay attention.",
    "The pen is okay, but the packaging is very basic, just a cardboard box with no protection, and the box the pen is in is glued with a large piece of clear tape, and the tape is still on the box.",
    "Treated like a 600 yuan item, it was a disappointing shopping experience.",
    "But the pen is not a problem.",
    "I hope to improve the packaging after the upgrade!",
    "Quality is not good, and if you talk about writing, it is not as good as 925-25.",
    "I would like to praise the delivery of TNT, air cargo, super fast, and the service attitude is also good!",
    "I have been using the 925-25 for a while now and it is great, just received the 925-85 and the pen is great quality, looks great, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not great for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the pen a bit too much and it wobbles a bit, but overall I think the 925-25 is a",
    "So he became an Amazon fanboy.",
    "I bought it at a super discounted price, but the result is that my child doesn't like to use the pen.",
    "It has been unsealed, and I tried to apply for a return, and it was delivered to me for free.",

    "It does not advocate returning the goods, but this service is the only one in China.",
    "I hope it is not abused.",
    "I moved my book collection here.",
    "The headphones have a slight hiss and some noise",
    "These headphones are trash, I don't know if it's my ears that are the problem or if these headphones are just not as good as they used to be.",
    "I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com. The sound quality was good, no noise, and the bass was good. I used it for more than two years, and it broke. I was going to buy another one (Urbeats), after all, it still felt good.",
    "I looked at the purple one and it looks good, but when I bought it, I opened it today and it didn\u2019t sound right, it was either too loud or too soft.",
    "I didn't think much about the reason why the sound effect of the song was not good, but after listening for half an hour, I found that the problem was serious, not only the tonal quality was not good, but also the bass effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise, is it only this purple one that has this phenomenon? Or is the current headphone manufacturing technology really not good?",
    "Very poor rating, very disappointed.",
    "I have to return it tomorrow.",
    "PS, the appearance is not bad.",

    "I just bought the German version of DN1080 on August 14th. I saw that the appearance was good and bad.",
    "1.The front panel and the knob are all plastic.",
    "2. The back panel audio input jack and the speaker output terminal are not good, and it is better to find a CD amplifier integrated machine with a price of 1000-2000.",
    "3. The cover is comparatively thin, my transformer is still recessed, I had to open the box and use my hands to restore it, the cover and the front panel are loose.",
    "4. The whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, and it is very awkward to move.",
    "It feels like a Sony entry-level machine, in terms of build quality, it's made in Malaysia.",
    "Sony seems to be better than Xiaomi in terms of outsourcing production to China.",
    "5. The machine is hot, and the two-channel 2-hour movie is about 40-50 \u00b0 C, and I don\u2019t know if the transformer is too hot.",
    "Now I use a switch power supply, this stupid transformer is estimated to be 4KG.",

    "As for the quality of the computer, I don\u2019t know, because it was bought for someone else, so I\u2019ll add a review later.",
    "I bought it half a year ago and used it a few times, but now it has been damaged, can you repair it?",
    "Because there is a desktop computer, I bought it and didn't use it many times.",
    "I just bring a few with me when I travel.",

    "I was shocked!",
    "Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?",
    "I seriously doubted the existence of life!",
    "I finally went to the pickup point and brought the computer back.",
    "The specific reason is simple, because the courier boy turned the two numbers upside down, fortunately, the package was not lost, so it was okay.",
    "I strongly recommend that Amazon does not use EMS, and in the future, if Amazon uses EMS to send parcels, I will definitely not buy it again.",
    "The goods are not bad.",
    "First of all, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was reduced in price, bad reviews, it was still not bad, it was cost-effective, the CPU and graphics card were enough to handle mainstream online games and quite a few large single-player games, the heat dissipation was very good, but the screen was a little dim (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality was not very good, and the hard drive was not very good",
    "(By the way, when you buy keyboard stickers, don\u2019t go to a store called E Cool Digital Center in a certain store. The delivery is slow, the quality is bad, and the products have problems, but they won\u2019t return or replace them. The boss also has dirty mouth, so I\u2019ll expose it.)",
    "The goods are good, and the platform bureaucrats are still the same.",
    "The hard drive is of very good quality, the price-performance ratio is absolutely high, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, absolutely recommended to buy if you are not in a hurry to use and can tolerate logistics.",
    "But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same as it was a few years ago when I swore that I would never use it. You can never find out the actual status of your shipment. Information is always a few weeks late. You can never complain. It\u2019s just so bureaucratic!",
    "The goods have been received for several days, and the logistics information is still that you will receive the goods in 10 days!",
    "Logistics is not carefree.",
    "It was delivered like this, not only was it compressed, but the electrical packaging was also open, and I don't know if it was repackaged.",
    "FYI",

    "I'm bored!",
    "Now put on the plastic wrap and continue to use it, I don't know how long it can be used?",
    "I bought someone else's disassembled one.",
    "The tax of more than 300 machines is indeed higher than that of more than 100 machines, but now it is more balanced with more than 600 machines.",
    "When I received it, the condition of the adhesive tape was not good, it looked like it had been opened, so I took a picture, and sure enough, it opened, and when I opened it, the paperboard inside was also damaged, I was afraid that someone had taken it back, so I quickly tried it on my husband before the anniversary, but the machine didn\u2019t turn on, luckily there was no hair in the blade, otherwise I would",
    "How good it is to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown, as the previous evaluation, the things sent out when out of stock are indeed not reliable!",
    "The experience is above average.",
    "It's pretty much top of the line electric, has a lot of different brushing modes, but I don't think many people change modes every day.",
    "I used it for half a year without any problems, I brushed it every day, and it crashed about once every week and a half.",
    "The brush head attachments are also cheap on Amazon.",
    "The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the color, the other seemingly compatible problems are the reason for the overseas version?",
    "I hope to learn the law.",
    "It's a good value.",
    "I have used it 3-4 times.",
    "1. Packaging is complete.",
    "2. It is very simple to use and easy to clean.",
    "3. You can do your own hair styling, which saves money.",
    "Overall, a very successful purchase.",
    "fake goods.",
    "I bought two bags last time, and they were two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the packaging were green, but one of them was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat ate it and got stomach ache.",
    "I can't tell if Amazon's inventory is fake or if it's just a case of employees dropping the ball when it comes to shipping.",
    "I will buy it again, and if it is still fake, I will find the relevant person to ask for compensation.",
    "It's the horizontal beam!",
    "Amazon picture is crooked, result sent to me is straight, is this a scam?",
    "the effect is not bad",

    "1. UN is Clarks most comfortable series, but unfortunately this one is too bad.",
    "Update: I compared the UN series cushion (the cushion was left on the shoe while the shoe was thrown away) with the old one, and the material is much worse, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, and it is just a fake soft.",
    "2. My heels are not high , the part of the foot that is being pressed is about 3 inches forward from the highest point of the heel .",
    "3. I bought three pairs of Clarks abroad, only one of them fits.",
    "I was so scared I deleted all of his music from my favorites.",
    "Try rockport again, if it doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019ll have to go to an Ecco physical store.",
    "Second best is better than nothing, and poor quality control",
    "First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime International Purchasing is very powerful, and the order I placed on the 31st was delivered on the 6th.",
    "The shoes are much better looking than the picture, and the leather feels good.",
    "The shoe size is a little bit bigger, 25 inches long, 10.5 inches wide, 7.5W, the upper is a little bit loose, but I like to wear loose shoes, and I just put on a pair of insoles.",
    "Secondly, the shoe quality control is really not good. One shoe sole has a broken, and the other shoe face has various scratches and a pinhole, and the glue strip at the connection between the shoe face and the shoe sole is misaligned, and it is obviously a second-rate product!",
    "I regret it a little!",
    "I bought the activity 280 pieces, this price is quite reasonable for Arthur's, of course, there are lower prices when you look at the reviews.",
    "Now let's talk about shoes, advantages: shoes are light, running is comfortable, and they fit better, and they won't fall apart.",
    "It's a high value but the flaws are also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, and this time I bought 40.5, and there is still about one thumb's length between the front of the shoe and my foot, but it doesn't affect anything.",
    "These shoes are very \"narrow\", although there is still distance in front, but it feels tight.",
    "And one more thing, the shoes are not breathable, and I feel my feet are hot.",
    "press your heels",
    "First, the shoes are well made and worth the price.",
    "My feet are standard, I wear running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, Amazon's love walking also bought a few pairs, they never fit, but these are the ones I refer to the reviews, I bought a size larger uk7, after putting them on, they are obviously longer, but because the insole is too thick, they are still awesome to press the back of the foot, and the hiking shoes are very hard, which makes it",
    "If your feet are not particularly thin, I would not recommend buying this.",
    "If you must buy, you can replace the insoles, but the original insoles look very high-end, which is a pity.",
    "Perfect shopping experience!",
    "I am very satisfied, I like it very much, Amazon overseas purchase is undoubtedly genuine, the quality is very good, the price is reasonable, I feel safe to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer service attitude is very friendly and gentle, the problem is patiently and efficiently solved, and the after-sales concerns are perfectly resolved, the package delivery is very convenient and reliable, the delivery person is very considerate of the customer",
    "In short, our whole family likes to shop on Amazon!",
    "Absolutely terrible!",
    "It's really hard to say anything about this agency and Amazon.",
    "Be careful about buying electronics from Amazon in the future.",
    "Although it has been a long time, I still have to complain.",
    "I bought it in winter, and it was sold out in seconds. I didn\u2019t buy it, and I didn\u2019t use it for a few months.",
    "I found that the heart rate monitor was not working when I tried to use it in the spring, and it wouldn't connect to the watch, even though both devices said they were compatible. I later found out that it was a problem with the heart rate monitor, because I tried to connect it to another device and it still wouldn't work.",
    "I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agency, which then asked me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.",
    "After almost half a month, the goods were sent back to me in the original packaging, even the courier box was the one I used to send it!",
    "No response and no follow up and no test report!",
    "You should have told me whether it was good or bad!",
    "I called and said that if they sent it back like that, it meant that the device was fine, and that was good.",
    "But I still can't connect, and the agency replies: That's not their business.",

    "Actually, they are all good, so I buy them online.",
    "Size: I'm 176cm tall, 68kg, my shoulders are 180cm wide, I bought an M, the waist is slightly long, the rest fits perfectly, I see that there are recommendations for S sizes, are you so slim? Or do you like tight clothes? I think the sweater is still loose.",
    "it's just the right size.",
    "Waist 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before buying and was told that I should buy xxl, then I read the comments and decided to buy L, and after receiving the package, I found that the size was just right, and I almost got cheated.",
    "The price of Double 11 is much higher than that of Black Friday.",
    "The quality of the clothes is very good.",
    "Z affordable goods problem is troublesome!",

    "Looks like I can't buy Z's cheap goods anymore!",
    "The toy is not well made.",
    "Most of the screw holes are not aligned, it is very difficult to screw up, which shows that the processing quality is not good, and I don\u2019t know how long I can play, because it is a promise to the child, and I won\u2019t withdraw.",
    "Other reviews say it was easy to install, does that mean only the one I bought had a problem?",
    "it's pretty average.",
    "Is it bad luck?",
    "The packaging is old; the workmanship is poor; the music is one-note and only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the moves are just shaking your head and walking forward with no variation.",
    "Not worth the price.",
    "I need it urgently, so I can\u2019t return it.",
    "The toy quality is good, but the packaging is a bit of a letdown",
    "I received the parcel yesterday, which was bought from Amazon, and it was marked as EMS delivery, and finally it was delivered by the courier of Tmall, how many bends did it turn? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall not good?",
    "The packaging is also a bit of a let down, it\u2019s wrapped in a few layers of plastic and there\u2019s no packaging foam inside, so when you open it up, all the parts are just in a box with a lot of empty space, luckily the toy quality is good and there aren\u2019t any broken parts, but there are a lot more parts than I was expecting, because it doesn\u2019t come with a battery and it\u2019s hand-",

    "I contacted the manufacturer and asked if the watch had a verification time when it was received. They replied \u201cyes\u201d, since it did, why was the time so different, it must be that the watch was not accurate, simply put, it was a fake product, not what I said, look, it was obvious that there was a quality problem (the numbers were not displayed completely), was it a fake product.",
    "I contacted the seller, and they gave me a bunch of reasons, and also complained that I shouldn\u2019t have bought their stuff in the first place, that kind of product, that kind of seller, that kind of customer service, who else would dare to buy stuff on Amazon.",

    "I am very satisfied with the watch",
    "It must be genuine, I checked the watch at the store, it looks beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, the material is good, and it is also an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight, and it is not comparable to those so-called mechanical watches of three or four hundred, this is a real deal.",
    "The watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the watch comes with a certificate of authenticity, the 12 stones on the dial are real diamonds, it is very suitable for yourself to wear, and it is also very good to give it as a gift.",

    "On the night of September 23, my wife dropped her phone. I immediately ordered an 8p from Malaysia on Amazon. It was in stock but not self-owned and did not increase the price (secretly happy). Because it was not self-owned, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the delivery was expected to arrive on September 27th.",
    "My wife was so upset that she didn\u2019t have a phone, so she called me at 6:30 in the morning to think about it, and then she went to JD.com to see if there was any 256G stock that could be delivered the same day, so she immediately ordered another one.",
    "I just bought it and I was thinking of cancelling my Amazon order.",
    "Because the order was placed at midnight, it was impossible to receive the delivery at dawn. I called the customer service at 7:30 to cancel the order, and the customer service replied that the order had been canceled, and I should wait for the text message notification.",
    "Okay, I'll wait patiently, and when I check my phone at noon, the order is still in the status of not shipped, so I immediately contact customer service to ask them to cancel the order as soon as possible, and the customer service replied that it has been operated OK.",
    "I checked my phone at 3 pm and the order was still there, so I had to contact customer service again to clarify that I had already called three times and asked them to cancel the order and inform the seller that the package must not be sent!",
    "The customer service contacted the seller on my request, and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system, and that I should wait until the seller was familiar with the system before cancelling the order.",
    "But I was explicitly told by the seller that they knew and that they would not ship.",
    "I checked the order status on Monday and it said it had been shipped, I was speechless.",
    "Unable to contact the seller directly, I called customer service again.",
    "The after-sale service is simply unspeakable, basically I say one step, and the customer service only operates one step.",
    "The order is still in the rejected state, and is being prepared to be sent again!",
    "Wouldn't Amazon be following up?",
    "The seller\u2019s company had already received the money, so it didn\u2019t matter if they followed up or not.",
    "In conclusion, I will never prepay for large items again, this is too much hassle.",
    "it looks beautiful.",
    "I had my eye on this lens for a long time, but I didn\u2019t buy it because of some reasons besides the price, but this time I bought it because of the bundle deal, and the price was still reasonable.",
    "I had no problem with the rest of the purchase, but when I connected the software, I couldn\u2019t connect at all. I have a TP router at home, and when I searched online, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours changing the settings of the router, but in the end, I used 360WIFI as a medium to solve it. In the meantime, I called the customer service of Xiaomi, but they",
    "Another thing worth noting is that I saw user comments online saying that the minimum storage card supported by this camera is 8G, and the storage capacity is too small, and it cannot be identified, so please pay attention to this.",
    "It feels good to use, the screen is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, the machine has a certain degree of heating, and if it is always opened, it feels that this degree of heating is a bit difficult to accept.",
    "In summary, there are many shortcomings in this product, and I hope everyone will be careful when buying.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because this was bought for the first love of life, and we have been in a relationship for almost 3 years, and he left me last year, and I still haven\u2019t got over it.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because I bought it for my first love in life, and I don\u2019t know how much I\u2019ve used it, or maybe I\u2019ve thrown it away!",
    "We have been in contact for three years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think of her, I feel heartbroken and want to leave this world. The first woman in my life has cast a shadow and pain on my life, and I have not been able to get over it yet.",
    "When I bought this phone, I thought about two things that I felt at that time, and I can still bear it together, but now it is unbearable to look back, maybe life is like this, some people never want to meet in their lifetime, some things they never want to know, but what can I do?",
    "Whenever I see a Samsung phone, my mind immediately goes to her, and the pain that comes with it, I have never been able to afford a phone that costs more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate, even though she was a good person, but when she changed her mind, all the promises and vows were gone.",
    "The masterpieces of domestic brands",
    "Huawei is a masterpiece in Chinese goods.",
    "The low-key CEO and the enterprise rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business atmosphere that relies on advertising to improve brand awareness!",
    "Enterprises without strength are absolutely impossible to do so, and they dare not do so!",
    "That's why I chose Huawei.",
    "I bought it more than half a year ago, and I feel good all the time, it is very good.",
    "I didn't give it a full score because once while using its offline navigation, it had a location issue and I couldn't figure out why, but otherwise it's been fine.",
    "And its online input is good, after searching, it automatically designs the route, and after leaving the wifi, its automatic offline navigation function is very useful, you don\u2019t need to run the flow, it directly talks to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, it\u2019s very good!",
    "Sony is the best.",
    "Sony's low-end phone is still well designed, affordable, has a large screen, excellent battery life, and is suitable for the elderly.",
    "It's been a long time, but the machine is still in good condition.",
    "However, since my Z2 was downgraded, this phone has also completed its mission."
