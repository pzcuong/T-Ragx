    "The COVID-19 pandemic may further expand the drug market, possibly due to increased farming by more farmers or the illegal cultivation of crops, or because of the weakening of government control, or because more people may be forced to engage in illegal activities in an economic crisis.",
    "The related restrictions on COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land transport, while sea transport may have increased as a result, the seas are relatively safe and the number of smuggled goods is higher by sea than by air or land.",
    "Recently, there have been reports that cocaine shipments are being directly transported from South America by sea to Europe.",
    "",
    "Non-controlled substances are appearing in stable numbers, but new types of potentially harmful opioids are on the rise in the drug market.",
    "Except for cannabis, cocaine and heroin, a number of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The use of non-medical drugs is also rapidly increasing.",
    "Approximately 500 new psychoactive substances are introduced into the domestic markets of member countries each year.",
    "At present, most of them are stimulants, followed by a small number of cannabinoid receptor agonists and a few synthetic opioids.",
    "Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "The total number of new psychoactive substances in the 2014 classification of new psychoactive substances is 2%, but by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.",
    "Many synthetic opioids similar to fentanyl have been proven to have both drug effect and harmfulness, and they have caused overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but in lesser degrees.",
    "In North America, fentanyl is sometimes used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and sometimes to produce counterfeit opioids.",
    "Evidence suggests that there is also the illicit manufacture and trafficking of stimulant-type new psychoactive substances in Europe: a study of residues in discarded syringes in six European cities found that many syringes contained substances that produce stimulating effects, which is a new phenomenon in Europe.",
    "2. The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become established in vulnerable groups.",
    "Single types of new psychoactive substances rarely form large markets.",
    "However, evidence from Europe indicates that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem in the groups of homeless people and prisoners who are on the margins of society.",
    "Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most of them identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.",
    "Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate, and many chemicals used as precursors to methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (commonly known as \"ecstasy\"), and \"ecstasy\" have been placed under international control.",
    "Traffickers and drug manufacturers have always been on the lookout for alternatives, not only those that are loosely regulated, but also those that are specifically designed to evade control, i.e., so-called \"precursor chemicals designed to circumvent regulation.\"",
    "Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the further spread of the coronavirus are likely to put additional pressure on drug traffickers who rely on precursor chemicals.",
    "This is now a reality: According to reports, in March 2020, the shortage of methamphetamine precursors from East Asia led to a price increase for methamphetamine in Mexico and the United States.",

    "The number of opioids intercepted by Russian authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has decreased significantly.",
    "However, the market for stimulants seemed to be growing rapidly.",
    "Evidence suggests that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and pyrrolidine, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.",
    "The Russian authorities reported a sharp increase in the number of secret laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs recently discovered, which doubled in two years and reached 152 in 2018.",
    "The methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq have grown significantly in recent years.",
    "Already in 2012, investigations into hospital, prison and other institution staff had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.",
    "Crystal methamphetamine has become another major cause for concern, following fentanyl and tramadol.",
    "A study conducted in 2015 further confirmed these findings, with drug users reporting that marijuana is harder to obtain than Captagon or methcathinone.",
    "Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine manufacturing sites, and the Narcotics Control Board has expressed concern about the import of large amounts of pseudoephedrine precursors. Methamphetamine precursors are used at these sites to produce methamphetamine.",
    "In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production appears to have started in 2014.",
    "Since then, the seizure volume of methamphetamine has steadily increased.",
    "However, the seizure volume in the first half of 2019 was 657 kg, a large increase compared to the previous year.",
    "Large quantities of crystallized methamphetamine believed to be from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, which indicates that production in that country is rapidly increasing.",
    "Policy changes and trends of change.",
    "The trend towards the legalization of marijuana for non-medical use is prevalent in most jurisdictions where marijuana use is increasing.",
    "In Canada, Uruguay, and the United States, 11 regions allow the production of marijuana products for non-medical use.",
    "In most jurisdictions, marijuana use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical marijuana use.",
    "In the two states where marijuana was legalized first in the United States, Colorado and Washington, the number of adults using marijuana for non-medical purposes has increased, particularly in the past month and on a daily or almost daily basis, and has already exceeded the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that since 2011, Uruguay's marijuana use has increased, with the number of users in the previous month increasing almost tenfold.",
    "This indicates that the main reason for the increase is frequent and frequent use of marijuana.",
    "Canada's short-term data also shows that, while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, use also increased.",
    "However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.",
    "The reason for the global drop in cannabis herb seizures is the legalization of cannabis?",
    "In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a reduction in seizures in North America, which had fallen by 84% over the past 10 years.",
    "Compared to this, the seizures in other parts of the world have almost doubled. The seizure patterns indicate that the policy aimed at legalizing the cannabis market has played a key role in the decrease.",
    "The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to be having an effect in the domestic market, but the effectiveness of regulation is still difficult to assess.",
    "Countries that have adopted different regulatory approaches for new psychoactive substances show different levels of new psychoactive substance use.",
    "In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after the introduction of national legislation.",
    "Weakened groups face the risks of both legal and illegal drug markets for pain management and palliative care, and opioid painkillers are primarily provided in high-income countries for pain management. Pain relief is unevenly distributed across regions.",
    "In 2018, more than 90% of the medical opioids available for consumption were produced in high-income countries.",
    "Approximately 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.",
    "Their population accounts for about 12% of the global population.",
    "According to estimates, the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but only 10% of the population consumes prescription opioids.",
    "Obtaining prescription opioids is associated with a number of factors, including legislation, culture, the health system, and prescribing practices.",
    "People living in poverty are more likely to suffer from drug addiction. In 2018, about 35.6 million people were addicted to drugs.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where individual socioeconomic trajectories are not only a reflection of their circumstances at a particular point in time, but also a factor in the risk of addiction.",
    "Drug-related diseases also deepen social and economic disadvantages, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to the degrading attitudes and consequences found within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, displaced people, and those living in rural areas may also be disproportionately affected by drug abuse, or face difficulties in accessing treatment.",
    "According to the DALY indicator, which estimates the years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death caused by addiction, the negative social impact has become more pronounced in the past 10 years.",
    "From 2007 to 2018, the global number of disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17%.",
    "Liver cancer-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are particularly high in injecting drug users with untreated hepatitis C\u201440%.",
    "The links between drugs and violence are complex and it is difficult to determine the causal relationships between all the factors involved in the use of psychotropic substances and violence.",
    "Limited global data suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in murder.",
    "However, in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a greater role than drugs.",
    "Although drug abuse may lead to crime, in some cases, the connection can be partly attributed to a variety of mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage, as well as other types of adversity caused by individual risk factors, family environment, and peers.",
    "The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, including international drug trafficking, large-scale organized crime may be carried out without violence.",
    "In the short term, the presence and intensity of violence is not determined by the amount of drug trafficking, but rather by certain changes in the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of a notorious criminal, and enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.",
    "\u6700\u65b0\u8da8\u52e2",
    "Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids cause the most harm.",
    "It is estimated that 1.92 billion people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug globally.",
    "In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "However, the related dangers of opioids are often overlooked because of their limited use.",
    "In the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and in the estimated 210 million years of life lost due to disabilities or premature death attributed to drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.",
    "The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, tramadol exacerbates the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl. These regions have little in common in terms of economic, demographic, or drug use statistics, but are struggling to cope with the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and cheap substances.",
    "In North America, the use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to a significant increase in overdose deaths from opioids over the past 20 years.",
    "In 2018, 32.5 percent of overdose deaths in the United States involved fentanyl.",
    "Canada also reported similar figures, but in lower numbers.",
    "Part of the reason for fentanyl-related overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.",
    "The market for non-medical use of tramadol has grown substantially in West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa.",
    "",
    "In 2017, the global seizure of tramadol peaked at over 125 tons.",
    "However, after a new law was passed in India in 2018 regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons in 2018.",
    "The crisis in these two regions was caused by the simple manufacturing process and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or precursors.",
    "These efforts facilitated the prevention of diversion of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances into illicit traffic. This facilitated the worsening of the crisis in these regions, as these substances are supplied in the legitimate and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.",
    "Stimulants are becoming increasingly popular.",
    "Amphetamine and methamphetamine are the main stimulants in the market, and their use is on the rise in their major markets.",
    "Around 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, because cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "About 27 million people used methamphetamine in 2018, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used type of ATS in both East and South-East Asia and North America.",
    "According to the available data, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes replacing each other, so that the use of one drug increases while the use of the other decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the needs of the same market.",
    "COVID-19 increases the risk for intravenous drug users.",
    "It is estimated that there are about 11.3 million people who inject drugs, and about 10% of them are infected with HIV due to injection drug use.",
    "More than 1.6 million people who inject drugs have HIV and 5.5 million have Hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, there were about 585,000 deaths due to drug abuse, of which half were caused by liver disease caused by Hepatitis B, and most of the Hepatitis B sufferers were not receiving treatment.",
    "The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead to the use of alcohol or other easily available substances, such as benzodiazepines or synthetic opioids, or the mixing of opioids with synthetic drugs.",
    "As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, there may be more harmful use patterns.",
