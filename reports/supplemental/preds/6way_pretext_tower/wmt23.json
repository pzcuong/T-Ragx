    "For example, you can get a white solar LED garden light for around 1,500 yen at a home center (the latest ones are very bright and can be installed in groups of 6).",
    "Since it is solar, I don't need to pay for electricity, but since I don't turn on the lights until morning, I also have 3 100V human-sensing LED sensor lights.",
    "With this combination, the distance at which a human silhouette can be recognized was ensured to be 30 m.",
    "Also, for daytime security, I think people who feel that the camera is small and the intimidation effect is weak will need to cover it with something.",

    "Original product from the security camera manufacturer I used before.",
    "It\u2019s better to use the manufacturer\u2019s product than what is sold at home centers.",

    "The protagonist's elderly mother, who is pretending to be crazy, knows that her husband (the protagonist's real father) was killed by her daughter, but her daughter doesn't know that (publicly, the real father's death was made to look like an overdose).",

    "I started competing in DTM at the age of 66 to prevent myself from getting bored.",
    "I bought the audio interface and the microphone.",
    "I started out with a lot of force, but I got stuck on the piano and I'm practicing every day.",
    "I downloaded some stock sounds but the project didn't work out, I downloaded ASIO at first but I found free piano sounds sounded better so I use that for piano practice.",

    "It takes 40 minutes to assemble.",
    "Finished and confirmed the product.",
    "The reclining armrests are different in terms of how hard they are to raise and lower, and it's harder to raise the left side and easier to raise the right side, which makes the armrests less comfortable to use (there's no way to adjust them).",

    "The seat feels hard and uncomfortable (does it lack elasticity?",
    ")The backrest mesh is stiffer and thinner than other mesh chairs, which can hurt your back if you sit on it too thin.",
    "Small things, but the height from the seat to the ground is 530 instead of 550 (height is important for tall people) and the part of the castor that supports the legs is not made of steel, so durability is questionable.",
    "I have a separate cushion and I use a towel to cover the mesh part because it tends to wear out quickly.",
    "I\u2019m 186cm 80kg and I felt the fit on the back was good but the rest was not satisfactory, I felt it was a miss-sized product.",
    "Maybe you should go and sit on the office chairs before you buy them.",
    "I received a welcome email from the manufacturer, so I'm going to ask about the armrest and headrest.",
    "Under consideration.",
    "I don't know what this is.",
    "I bought a Pixel 4K tuner, which is cheap and not very expected because it seems that the environment of my house is right-handed and BS4K.",

    "(Sometimes the image jumps) After purchasing, the update came immediately, and it was compatible with recording, so I made a few reservations and watched them, but I think the external HDD also affects it, because when I play it, the image stops, or the frame skips.",
    "The UI is not praised at all, and they are content with \"4K broadcasting can be seen\".",
    "By the way, I feel that during the pre-recorded recording, only the replay of the recorded program can be played, and I also accept this as a plus feature that the HDD can also be recorded in 4K.",

    "I hope it gets better with the update.",
    "Heating function is OK",

    "Enter and Backspace keys also stopped working.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it at all but if you have a thousand yen to spare you could try it out.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use it for half a year.",
    "Other companies offer 1-3 years warranty for the same price range, but this one only offers 6 months.",
    "The short warranty speaks to the fragility.",
    "Products are the best, packaging is the worst.",
    "The product is different colors and I love it.",
    "I would like to recommend the food stocker to anyone looking for one! !",
    "However, there was a lot of space between the large cardboard boxes and the packaging was the worst I\u2019ve ever seen.",
    "The lid was off when I opened the box.",
    "I would recommend the product but you might be better off buying elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the intensity, but for now",
    "I bought a replacement lid because the support was not satisfactory.",
    "It does its job in terms of stability, but it's a delicate plastic product, so if you're not careful when opening and closing the lid, it makes a really annoying \"crinkle crinkle (it's going to break)\" sound.",
    "You have to be careful when buying because you can't just choose the thickness that fits your lid.",
    "The meatballs are cute back",
    "I was looking for a backpack to take my dog out and found this grey backpack that I fell in love with and bought it.",
    "It's a snap together type of thing and it's surprisingly light when you hold it so it doesn't feel too heavy.",
    "The zipper also moves smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "It's comfortable to wear even for long periods of time.",
    "It's very compact and easy to fold.",
    "It folds up and the meatball design is still visible, and it's cute when you put it down.",
    "Light and comfortable!",
    "The slide is also easy to use.",
    "First, I was immediately attracted to the appearance and low price, so I bought it!",
    "I\u2019ve had TSA locks for a few years and have a few others but they are convenient.",
    "And for the forgetful and lost keys, I recommend number lock.",
    "However, I honestly put the most importance on lightness so it's good for that  but if you want durability and security, the snap closure is loud and the fabric tears in one second if you cut it with a knife.",
    "Also, the seam of the zipper is sweet, so I need to work on overlapping.",
    "I would recommend bringing it on board if you are traveling abroad.",
    "I used it on my shinkansen trip and it was comfortable.",

    "I felt like my pinky finger was hitting it.",
    "So I bought a 25cm.",
    "I opened it and it was huge.",
    "I tried it on and it was a bit loose even with socks on.",
    "I was struggling with whether to return it but I think it's too bad at 24.5 so I'm going to keep it and wear it at 25.",

    "Also, if you walk while you are vigorously moving up and down, you will get pulled up from below.",
    "<Making the product> The fabric is durable and not too thin, so there is no need to worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "At this price, I'd be happy with this build but I think the smaller one would fit better.",
    "I guess there was a gas leak...",
    "The Silver Colt 25 has a gas leak, and when you replace the valve, you have a problem with the tank being missing.  I recommend using the [Ball Bond Q] to seal the tank and repair the grease fittings, and then you can shoot it with confidence.  If you want to buy this Colt 25, you can ask the person who can disassemble it or take pictures while disassembling, but I don",
    "I thought it was 188 yen, but I thought it was a good quality.",
    "You can use the early shifting and torque when needed.",
    "Light, small, and simple is better.",
    "There is no gap when attaching the bit, and I thought it was a surprisingly cheap cost for 188 yen.",
    "I'm curious about how durable it is.",
    "I don\u2019t use it that often but I think it\u2019s a good thing to have in your toolbox.",
    "I purchased this along with the same manufacturer's \"1/4 inch hex magnetic quick release driver rotator bit holder 60/100/150mm\"",
    "No problems here, it was pretty good value for money.",
    "the controller will not move",
    "The player's own vehicle will move on its own and become uncontrollable.",
    "You can operate it by reconnecting the cable, but after a few minutes, the console will move in the wrong direction and you won't be able to operate it.",
    "Don't buy this product.",
    "I'll give you a warning.",
    "Terrible product.",
    "It's wired, but I would recommend the controller for the BEBONCOOL PS3.",
    "They are reliable and can last a long time without breaking.",
    "It can also be used in PC games.",

    "Does this increase the computational power?",
    "I think it's for kids who understand math.",
    "Wouldn't it be unreasonable to expect a child who doesn't understand math to do it?",
    "It's a difficult problem.",
    "Also, when it comes to giving the parent the tools, I have to point up at the screen with my finger and give them the tools, but I have tried that and it never works smoothly.",
    "I guess it\u2019s easier to fool someone who\u2019s used to DS.",
    "I can't get into the character illustrations in manga, I think the DS and other screens are getting more and more boring, but I can't get into them for some reason.",
    "The way it's calculated is like a race against time, like how many questions you can answer in a minute.",
    "I understand that you are in a hurry to get things done in tests, but do you get anxious and start calculating?",
    "I don't like the fact that it ends with a gong.",
    "You\u2019re putting in the work, why not make it sound a bit nicer?",
    "I feel like I've lost 6,200 yen.",
    "I know what this is worth.",

    "No story, feels shorter than the last one.",
    "The music is really good!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel good!",
    "Persona 3 characters were the first to be HD, so I was moved when I first saw them.",
    "I guess Hikaru looks like a pretty boy (laugh) Persona 5 is beautiful from the start, so there's no freshness... If you think that, then 3 is more affordable.",
    "As a sound game, I felt 5 was more fun than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is mostly blue, but it's hard to see the backgrounds.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is covered by the background.",
    "I think that with the abundance of assist features, even those who are not good at playing games can enjoy it.",
    "I think that sound game experts will make it a challenging game by turning on the challenge function.",
    "The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just a few tracks, it's a solid 4 disc set, so if you like Persona music, I recommend this.",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the keyboard on the picture but the actual one is a bit blue but it's close to black or charcoal gray.",
    "And it wasn't a double buckle.",
    "I was thinking about buying gold but I\u2019m still on the fence, should I just give up on it because it\u2019s cheap?",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering a new product in exchange.",
    "The rest of the process was quick.",
    "I think the response was very good despite the cheap product.",
    "4 stars for the response.  I also bought the gold.",
    "The color is pretty much as it is in the picture and it looks very nice.",
    "But the back is not double lock, the difference with the illustration is clear.",
    "That's the only thing that sucks.",
    "The evening gets really heavy.",
    "I used the SIM free iPhone 7s.",
    "In the first setup, I didn\u2019t know what to do after I got to Korea and pointed my SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo airport (go to settings > mobile communication > communication options and turn data roaming ON) and she helped me out.",
    "The advice that came with the product didn\u2019t seem to matter much...?",
    "However, the airport area around Gimpo Airport is not good for radio waves, so I had to hold on to 3G for a long time.",
    "When it comes out in the city, it becomes 4G.",
    "As the evening and night approached, the connection would get really slow sometimes, but looking back I think it might have hit a daily limit of a few hundred MB.",
    "better than i thought.",
    "I used Softbank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim free and used it on Ymobile, but since the Z4 was not working well, I was looking for a used Xperia to buy, but I found this phone and bought it.",
    "I used the mobile Suica, so I was worried if it would work properly, but it was no problem at all.",
    "Size, weight, silver, bought it, looks like iPhone6?",
    "I don't play games so the processing speed is the same as Z4, it feels a bit faster.  In the review, it was said that the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a bit of time to recognize it, so I use the face recognition.",
    "I thought it was like an iPhone and it was amazing. I also upgraded my Android to Ver9 and I was able to make a satisfying purchase.",
    "Things I noticed: I wish it was a little smaller  No strap hole  * Works with cases that have a strap hole  Not waterproof  A little heavy  I\u2019ve only used it a little bit so far but I\u2019m satisfied with it  I recommend it"
