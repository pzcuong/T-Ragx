    "The COVID-19 pandemic may further expand the illicit drug market, as the pandemic may lead to more farmers to increase or engage in illicit cultivation, or because of the reduced control capacity of the national regulatory authorities, or because more people may be forced to engage in illicit activities due to the economic crisis.",
    "The restrictions on travel related to COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, but may have increased maritime transport, which has a lower risk of interception and more volume than air or land smuggling.",

    "there are about 500 new active ingredients in the domestic market of member states each year.",
    "currently , most of these are stimulants , followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a few opioid analogs .",
    "although the overall number of new psychotropic drugs has stabilized , the proportions have changed .",
    "of the newly identified neuroactive substance types in 2014, only 2 % were classified as novel opioids , but this number had risen to 9 % by 2018 .",
    "among the new synthetic psychoactive substances , many are similar to fentanyl , and their effects and risks have been documented , with overdose deaths in North America and elsewhere , although to a lesser degree .",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other opioids (including heroin and methylfentanyl ) and as a precursor for counterfeit fentanyl analogs .",
    "some evidence suggests that injection of new psychoactive substances is also occurring in Europe : a study of residual syringes in six European cities found that many of them were contaminated with substances that produce stimulation >",
    "the use of 2 new psychostimulants may gradually become entrenched in the weak subculture",
    "a single new class of psychotropic agents has rarely formed a large market .",

    "twenty2 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons , with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the primary challenge .",
    "The control of precursor chemicals for the synthesis of illicit drugs has forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many precursor chemicals used in the synthesis of illicit drugs such as buprenorphine, methylbuprenorphine, and \"nodding pills\" have been placed under international control.",

    "In Afghanistan , methyl isocyanide production appears to have begun in 2014.",
    "since then , the seizure quantity of methylamphetamine has been steadily increasing .",
    "However, the seizure quantity in the first half of 2019 was 657kg - a significant increase compared to the previous year.",

    "All indicators show that the use of marijuana in Bolivia has increased since 2011, and last month it almost doubled.",
    "This suggests that the increase is mainly due to frequent and heavy use of marijuana .",
    "Canadian short-term data also shows that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage increased.",
    "However, 40 percent of marijuana users still obtained some products illegally in 2019.",
    "Is the global marijuana crop seizure decline due to marijuana legalization?",
    "In 2018, global cannabis seizures reached their lowest levels in the past 20 years, due to a 84% decline in seizures in North America over the past decade.",
    "in contrast , the number of arrests in other parts of the world nearly doubled during the same period . The arrest data suggest that policies intended to liberalize marijuana markets are having a significant impact .",
    "monitoring of new psychoactive substances appears to have a dampening effect on their availability within the country , but the effectiveness of this monitoring is still difficult to assess .",
    "some countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances have different rates of use of these substances .",

    "The risk of addiction is higher for the poor. In 2018, about 35.6 million people were addicted to drugs.",
    "poverty , limited education , and social marginalization may increase the risk of addiction and worsen its consequences . evidence from high - income countries suggests that these factors are not only associated with an individual's status at a particular point in time , but also with addiction risk .",
    "Addiction also exacerbates social and economic disadvantage , further increasing the risk of unemployment , poverty , and homelessness , which in turn can reinforce the vicious cycle of disadvantage . These outcomes may also be linked to the stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system .",

    "the relationship between drug use and violence is complex and difficult to determine the causal relationship between all the factors of substance use and violence .",
    "global data suggest that drunkenness is a major factor in homicides .",
    "But in violent events, alcohol seems to have a greater effect than drugs.",
    "although drug use may be associated with criminal behavior , in some cases this association can be partially attributed to multiple intervening factors , such as social economic disadvantage and other types of adversity that are influenced by personal risk , family environment , and peers .",
    "the relationship between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted .",
    "if a stable criminal structure exists , including large , organized criminal activities such as international drug trafficking , they may be able to be implemented without violence .",
    "in the short term , the presence and degree of violence are more likely to depend on certain changes that destabilize the power balance between organized criminal groups , such as changes in the size of the illegal market , the death or incarceration of prominent criminals , and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another .",

These regions have little in common economically, demographically, or in general patterns of drug use, but they are all struggling to combat a crisis fueled by the easy availability and low cost of these substances.",
    "in North America , the use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to a surge in overdose deaths over the past 20 years .",
    "In 2018 , of the 67,367 excess deaths registered in the United States , more than two thirds involved fentanyl .",

    "the two crises were fueled by the production of simple , low @-@ cost products , as well as a lack of international oversight of curmudgeon and many other fintails .",

Then, the media reported that the US government was considering cutting off all connections between US suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden government also prepared to issue an administrative order to restrict US investment in China'",

On the other hand, it has built a semiconductor industry alliance to completely \"disconnect\" China from advanced semiconductor industries.",

These factors will be adjusted in the future (the number of non-agricultural employment in January 2022 was revised downward from 504,000 to 364,000), and the non-agricultural",
    "From the perspective of structure, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have seen a significant increase in new employment, and data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry is still there.",
    "With the rebound and recovery of the same size as expected service sector PMI, job vacancies and labor shortages, and the strong momentum of consumption credit data, we judge that the US service sector has come back quickly after extreme weather and holidays.",

    "Before this data release, the U.S. bond market was overly optimistic about the Fed's rate hike path.",
    "As inflation data continued to improve, the Fed shortened the pace of rate hikes while still maintaining the fragile balance of market expectations for inflation, but the market ignored the hawkish tone of the Fed and expected an early end to rate hikes and two rate cuts at the end of the year.",
    "Given the tight labor market and uncertainty about the impact of tightening policy, we believe the FOMC's guidance at the end of the year to raise rates is relatively reasonable, and extreme market expectations for adjustment and trading compression or will cause some damage to the market.",
    "However, the stubbornly high wage growth is unlikely to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, as M2 data turned negative on a year-on-year basis and various components of the CPI index have been improving gradually. Since October, US CPI data have been in a phase of rapid decline, and the stubbornly high wage growth will only serve as a floor for future inflation.

    "And to buy from them you have to contact their dodgy as hell Peak Express and that is the worst experience I have had buying anything from Amazon!",
    "The seller is not bad, actively cooperated with the courier and refunded in time, but the work of this peak express is really very frustrating, it took about half a month to refund, this partner is dragging the back of Amazon, the work efficiency is poor, and there is no service awareness!",

    "When I received the product, I was shocked. The surface of the product was scratched, and there were scratches in many other places. It was either a defective product or a used product. I will post a picture later.",
    "I applied for a refund, the factory people said they saw the picture and said it was caused by transportation, is that just saying it?",
    "How can the product be damaged?",
    "There are only two possibilities: either it is a defective used item, or I intentionally damage the item and return it for a refund.",
    "Objectively speaking, I don't have evidence to prove that I didn't damage the goods, but based on my Amazon shopping credit record, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's self-operated goods, customers choose Amazon self-operated goods is trust, customer win, we win, customer's win is the manufacturer's win, I hope everyone can work together to improve, thank you.",

    "I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but the right two groups of the receiver often show red E2, which is probably a problem with the transmitter. This is not consistent with the statement on Amazon's website that the transmitter can work for 7 years. I can't find any after-sales service on Amazon's website. What should I do?",
    "it's okay.",
    "The first time I bought it was a disaster.",
    "it doesn't feel new.",

    "The only downside is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I bought a phone from Amazon before.",
    "There is a sticker on the box to prevent it from being opened, but there is no sticker this time. There is also a sticker like the one on the phone when you buy it, which can be pasted on the warranty card. There is no sticker this time.",

    "I said: When the page is 7c, 8c, 9c, it is confusing. The Chinese customer service told me that the Japanese common code does not have c like this, but similar to 140. But do you go to other pages?",

    "China customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know when you will return, so we will not refund your shipping.",
    "I don't understand this logic, I am Japanese, I also need Chinese customer service, and Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service, so what's the point of calling Amazon's overseas purchase in Chinese, it's just like me, a Japanese person who is not good at international long-distance calls.",

The first time I bought it, I was quite satisfied. My baby used one diaper all night, and it could satisfy him for 12 hours without changing.",
    "However, this time when I bought the L size diaper, there were 2 packs in a box, and when I opened it, the paper felt a little loose, and it was quite different from the in-mouth baby helpers, and after my baby used it, it was okay, there was no leakage and no rashes.",

    "I think it's pretty good.",
    "The second one was ordered on the 27th, and it was delivered to us on the 12th, which was 15 days, or half a month. Amazon's delivery staff were also very good.",
    "Third, don't believe Amazon's black Friday, I ordered on Friday and it was cheaper after 2 days, about 12 dollars cheaper, so I paid more than 170 (including shipping), I felt like they were raising the price for the promotion.",
    "The price fluctuation that the customer service told me was like this, I have been paying attention to the price for more than ten days, and the price fluctuation is not big.",
    "Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with lead, I will definitely buy it again!",
    "The particles in the paste are just right for a refreshing feeling, and the teeth feel smooth after use. It is much better than some second-hand toothpaste. They say it is an imported product, but many things don't have Chinese labels, so I don't know where they were bought in bulk.",
    "From now on, if Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand stores.",
    "I have a suggestion, sometimes the items don't show up on Amazon's app, I hope you can improve the application, it's getting better!",

    "I won't spend a penny on excellence anymore.",
    "The image quality is just not acceptable.",
    "As a title for this book, \"The Atlas of Ancient Maps\" is really hard to accept, given the selection, layout, and printing of the images, some of which are even marred, and are so blurry that they are unrecognizable.",
    "Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if the illustrations are small, it should be worthy of the great vision of the ancestors of the catalog of ancient Chinese literature!",

    "and then... i fell into the pit.",
    "According to the plot, the whole book is relatively light and happy. The first part of the book is when Ye Xiu is still playing online games, even if there are conflicts between guilds, it is not heavy because Ye Xiu is often covered in blood from Ye God Dog.",
    "As for the competition part, it gave me a little bit of a bitter feeling about the alternation of the times (maybe I am too sensitive).",
    "I spent a lot of my high school time studying this book, but I couldn't stop.",
    "The full-time description of characters and emotions is very impressive. Some characters only appear occasionally, but they leave a deep impression on readers, such as Lei Xiu Huang Shao Tao and Zhuo Cheng, who are described in detail. Even the characters who are not in the center of the writing, such as Jiang Bo Tian and Yun Xiu, are also very popular. In a romance competition, it is difficult to find a character that readers hate,",
    "And on the emotional front, there is no general-interest web article-worthy courtier-like obsession with the three thousand million beauties, and the common thread of all the emotions is that they all enjoy playing this game and want to win honestly.",
    "They are so small and innocent, they look so simple and cute.",
    "Maybe that's why there's no villain in full-time.",
    "The full-time IP is also very large, and it is also a great achievement.",

    "How much he really gave us some energy, some emotion.",
    "The manga version will be released in April this year.",
    "I've wanted to buy this set for a long time, but I've never had enough money to buy it, and when I wanted to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fake goods on TB, and the latest version of the full-time version was released recently, I really like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version, so I went to Amazon to see if there was a set, and I bought it all at once.",
    "Now let me explain the situation with the goods.",
    "The fourth book has no shrink wrap, but it is new.",
    "The seventeenth book of plastic wrap was opened, but the texture of the book was also very strange, and it felt like it was not hard.",

    "\u25cfIt seems that different publishers for individual books are different, but the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, and different from others.",

    "The lonely little lion",
    "I thought it would be as simple as \"The Lost Wing\" when I got the book, but the text is still quite a lot!",
    "It took three times to read the book to the little boy, a lion who can shoot and a lion who loves juice candy.",
    "When I see a lion eating a hunter, I feel a little uncomfortable. Modern city people are not used to this arrangement.",
    "At the end, the successful little lion, lost, was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete man.",
    "Finally, only the back of the little tiger, and we didn't know where he went.",
    "Perhaps decades later, the image of the little lion will still be in the mind of the grown-up child, and it will be recalled by chance, and it may touch or inspire her.",
    "a high-value collection",
    "1. I didn't know TASCHEN before, but I bought a lot of their books recently because they are too strong, both in the selection and the production.",
    "This book has been published in three versions, the largest of which is almost 50cm long and 34cm wide, like the complete works of Moliere; the middle version is about 36cm long and 23cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a boxed set of two books.",
    "I think it is acceptable, because the price is low, and the 700 pages are divided into two books, which is more convenient for reading as a paperback; secondly, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, in which the painting takes up the main part, and the black and white sketches of da Vinci take up most of the book, so for budget-conscious readers who are not art experts, this version is the best price-per",
    "2. The commentary on the drawing part is excellent, with diagram analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the last dinner), but I don't know whether it is printed or handwritten, and some of the shadow parts are too deep, and the details are not clear, which is a pity.",
    "3) Compared to Michelangelo's draft, da Vinci's draft is rich in content.",
    "The former is a genius, the latter is too broad and too high to be described as a genius.",
    "If you only saw the paintings, you'd only get half of Dali. If you saw the manuscripts, you'd be speechless.",

    "The delivery is too slow, Amazon is already slow to begin with, and it's even slower than I thought!",
    "overall, i'm satisfied.",
    "At first I was worried about the packaging, this time it was fine, there was a bubble wrap inside, the serial number of the camera was the same, and it could be registered on the official website. The shutter count was 0, and the rest could only be checked by time.",
    "The delivery was fast, but I have to complain about the courier. He put the valuable items in the door room and left quickly. I couldn't check the package in front of him. I really have no words for this.",
    "The seller thought about the customer before shipping:)",
    "The vendor is more responsible, they actually call to ask about the size of the screen of the camera, they really care about the customers.",
    "The delivery speed is also fast.",
    "The gold foil is also quite suitable and useful.",
    "the battery is not charged.",
    "The machine is not bad, I want to ask why it is not full when it is charged for the first time, and the charging indicator light is always red.",
    "I couldn't find an official feedback channel for Amazon, so I can only leave feedback in the product review.",
    "On March 29, the book was purchased for 31 yuan through pre-order channels, and it was shown that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, but at that time, the Amazon website could not preview the book (because it had not been published);",
    "2. On March 31, the book pushed to the device was empty, and only waited for it, but the electronic version of the book was reduced to 18 yuan on Amazon;",
    "3. I tried to delete the blank book from my device and synced again, but I still couldn't get the e-book of The Essence of Business that contains real content. However, I saw that Amazon's website can preview the book.",
    "i have a few thoughts right now.",
    "The price issue is not the most important thing, the key is how to change the blank book on Kindle into a book with real content now, instead of downloading \"waiting for it\" forever",
    "2. After purchasing the book, it is unlikely that you will buy it again, because if you jump the queue, it will be complicated to download a book with empty content.",
    "3. We hope Amazon will provide a normal channel to feedback these questions, such as a place to feedback when downloading e-books or raising doubts (like a ticket system or online customer service, like Microsoft official store)",
    "I wouldn't recommend reading it.",
    "I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see the memory notes after reading it.",
    "This book is not a collection of short stories, but a collection of fragments of love in life.",
    "The tone of the book is very calm, like the calmness of water, the words and sentences are simple and concise, and the plot is also calm and peaceful, like a quiet afternoon street in summer.",
    "Each short is a clip of a mundane moment in life, without a beginning or an end.",
    "Finally, all the pieces were put together and the book was named \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".",
    "I think this collection of stories, and its title, is a kind of performance art, and the author wants to express that love is not just the tragic and joyful separation on the stage, the dried-up and withered life in urban legends, and not just the glue-like and paint-like you and me, but also the quiet and monotonous life, the dull and tasteless days, and also the helplessness, the escape from reality, and the uncertainty of",
    "As you read this book , you may recall the quarrelsome couple next door , the friendless marriage of an acquaintance , and the disappointing love affair .",
    "This is why I don\u2019t recommend it: from a critical perspective, the writing and plot are both bland, and unless your life is as exciting as a roller coaster or as sweet as a candy castle, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re reading something that\u2019s just weird and boring.",
    "And from a depth of thought, the daily situations do not make people bright or expand their thinking and vision (this is different from Marx's \"Love in the Time of Revolution\"), and the brief fragments do not discuss any problems, such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?",
    "what were the reasons for the protagonist's marital breakdown?",
    "So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't matter much.",
    "The author's ideas are more expressed through technique and tone than through plot, which is why the reading experience is less satisfying.",
    "It's suitable for coarse reading, not for fine reading.",
    "The logic of the book is good, but the content is not rich enough.",
    "many sales theories have been explained, but few have provided practical guidance on how to do it.",
    "Also, the book feels like it was cobbled together.",
    "For example, there are both domestic and foreign ones, and some are well-known businessmen or salesmen, while others are not well-known but have a good reputation.",
    "I don't know if the story was compiled for the sake of an example, but if some authors' own cases were cited, it would be more convincing.",
    "The term for the customer has changed from customer to client.",
    "The title is still customer, but the body is changed to customer.",
    "There were also problems with misspelled words, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.",

    "A Quick Guide to Internet Finance: The Definitive Guide",
    "This book is shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory course, which can help people quickly understand the overall situation of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still need to find a way to dig it yourself.",
    "And the book was published earlier, the content of later Alipay WeChat supplementing the war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned, and the share of third-party payment is probably much smaller than what is said in the book now.",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat just with their mobile phones, and merchants also gave up using UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.",
    "However, I would like to thank the author for writing this introductory book. It is obvious that the author has had many years of financial observation experience and is familiar with the financial development history of both China and the world, so he can write such clear and easy-to-understand content.",

    "In this book, the author explains five languages of appreciation: the language of affirmation, the language of appreciation, the language of connection, the language of service, and the language of touch.",
    "I don't think it's important that you know what the five languages are, but that you can use them spontaneously to praise, appreciate, and thank the people in your life - your family, your friends, your colleagues - for what they do for you.",

    "The quality is terrible, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it is even worse than the products sold on the roadside, there is no weight, no barcode, and even 10 bags are loose, it is a feature that is not qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience of Amazon, I have already applied for a refund; it is a problem of quality; I suggest merchants to open their eyes and refuse to buy low-quality goods; supplement: I",
    "Amazon is expected to be more stringent in its selection of suppliers.",
    "The products are not as good as expected.",
    "Advantages:",
    "1. Big brands, but cheap.",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both PANASONIC guaranteed, and they are still OK to use, but they are not as good as I expected.",
    "disadvantages:",
    "1. The charger has no indicator light, which is the most basic feature of your power indicator, and the customers who buy a 300 yuan product are considered to be discarded by Panasonic, with no respect.",
    "2. Strong odor: The plastic burning smell is strong when charging, even for just 10 minutes.",
    "The office tried it for one day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.",
    "Compared to the Philips I used before at the same price, although there is a knife, but the quality of this product is really not good for consumers.",
    "small packages",
    "I received the express, and I saw the word \"electronic version\" on the top, and I knew I had fallen into the pit again. It was cheaper than buying it at the supermarket. It was probably M, and the packaging of the picture on the product introduction was different, so it was called the new version.",
    "Three stars are sorry for not paying attention to the product specification, I don't mind selling M code e-commerce version, what does it mean to be a wrong version?",
    "The e-commerce platform is quite sophisticated, but I still went to the supermarket to buy some things.",
    "just the soy sauce.",
    "i don't like the taste.",
    "Kids don't like the taste of toothpaste and always say it's spicy, maybe they could use another word, but that's all they have in their vocabulary right now.",
    "I bought it when I was doing an activity, it was very cheap, so I don't want to give a bad review, I'll give it 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.",
    "it's the real thing, it's packaged.",
    "The package is complete, and there is a gas bag inside, and there are no online reviews except for the shape of the product of the bald head.",
    "The plastic wrap on the outside of the bottle was also like the picture described, and the delivery was very fast, and the second day came.",
    "It is the genuine product, but it is out of stock, and I don't know when it will be back on sale.",
    "A terrible shopping experience",
    "I sent a package during the black 5, but I didn't receive it for a long time after that. I asked about it later, and I was told that the package had already been delivered. I asked my colleagues, and they said they didn't help deliver it. I contacted the courier company, and they said I had to send the package before I could make an inquiry. I contacted Amazon's customer service, and I waited for more than ten days. I",
    "The wrong pairing",
    "I thought I could get the headphones in the picture 1, but I got the headphones in the picture 2, even if the picture is inconsistent, what does the sound volume difference between the left and right headphones mean?",
    "Although the names are the same, please pay attention to the difference. Also, please update the correct images in time, thank you very much.",
    "The operating system is pretty good.",
    "It's been a while, overall the screen is okay, I don't feel any difference, but the system makes you feel complicated, the boot time is obviously slower, and the settings are not good, the software that comes with it is not worth mentioning, and the response speed is even more ordinary, compared to my own family, it is not a level.",
    "The reviewers say it is very humanized, but I can't find where it is humanized. The position of the common up and down, left and right, and return key is really not good.",
    "So, just use a TV and a box or something.",
    "the price is too low.",
    "The price is too low, now it's 99!",
    "Amazon has accumulated a lot of unrated orders, so I use a copy of a sentence as the rating content.",
    "If I were to rate this product based on this statement, I would give it at least 85 points.",
    "But I would never copy and paste bad reviews, because other consumers would use them as reference when they buy, and the merchants would improve the quality of the product.",
    "The low-priced good line, it's enough if it doesn't burn!",
    "This cheap cable should have reached the HDMI certification standard, I have personally compared it with the domestic autumn leaves and these dog shit toys (prices have been doubled), the cable is thick and sturdy, and it is relatively soft, and there is no noise in the transmission of 7 meters, and I will recognize the low-priced cables in the future!",
    "The product is fine, but Amazon's after-sales service is really worse than other websites.",
    "After placing the order, I realized I had made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order, and the website's online customer service always showed an error link, but I couldn't get through.",
    "After the delivery, the delivery man called me and said that I didn't want it, and I couldn't cancel the order, so he took it back and asked me to sign for it and apply for a refund.",
    "When I applied for a refund, I was told that food items cannot be refunded once they have been received, and that I couldn't call Amazon customer service, and they also said that once received, it cannot be refunded.",
    "I have bought some items that cannot be returned for policy reasons, including milk and diapers, from JD.com and Suning.com before, and contacted the customer service to return them, and JD.com's diapers had a strong smell after opening, and the customer service also returned it to me, but you can't do it on Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, people are alive, contact our customer service and tell us how to handle it.",
    "Tell me whether I should buy it myself or let the delivery guy buy it himself. The delivery guy is already hard enough, why should I ask him to buy something that isn't his?",
    "i'm not going to back down, i'll take it myself, but i'll give you guys a point for the service.",
    "Don't waste your money",
    "First, I was looking forward to buying it, I thought that the Dole brand would not be bad, after receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay, the taste was not bad, but one box was basically soft, you couldn't tell from the outside, it didn't have a texture, and there was no taste when you bit into it, it was bland and tasteless, the fruit around the circle was dark yellow, which was bad, it was a bad product that",
    "Eat a bowl of rice and grow a brain, you'll never buy fruit from the supermarket again!",
    "Where is the anti-counterfeit label?",
    "The bottom corner of the bottle is quite deep, which must have been caused by a strong impact, and the feeling of bouncing around in the outer packaging is quite painful, because the packaging for food is too simple, and it is also imported, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark, and it is very easy to open the bottle, the key is that the layer of honey on the lid directly comes out, and there is almost no stickiness when opening, are all",
    "I don't understand, I was born in China.",
    "it's probably the real thing.",
    "I also got a message saying that it would be delivered between 20 and 22, this is the 14th number I received, I bought it for the first time abroad, I just wrote down my doubts, maybe it's normal?",
    "Delivery service needs improvement",
    "I bought 5 coupons, when I was going to pick them up, I reserved 3 times, but only 2 were sent to me, after many communications, it was confirmed that it was a mistake, and they promised to send the remaining one; the second time I reserved, I happened to be on a holiday, and the website and WeChat did not remind me to reserve on a working day, which caused unnecessary anxiety, and I suggest that this should be improved in the future",
    "good shopping.",
    "it's good!",
    "It's still better to believe in Amazon's self-operated things. Now that you buy abroad, it's very convenient. The logistics time from abroad to buy back is a few days longer than that of domestic logistics, but Amazon's clearance ability from abroad to domestic is still very strong, which is much faster than transshipment, so many things are bought abroad.",
    "I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are made in China, but they are cheaper when you go abroad and come back than when you buy them in China. I hope it can be improved.",
    "garbage",
    "When you see this package, do you think it is roadside garbage?",
    "A plastic, breakable package, and a plastic bag from Germany, is that responsible?",
    "I see this packaging as trashy as well, buying this product, packaging and its simplicity, no preventive measures, just a simple plastic bag packaging, when it arrives, the packaging is completely deformed and the items inside are damaged.",
    "If I just got one I would have been fine, but I bought a few and when I went to Amazon customer service they said I could return them but I would have to pay for shipping and then they would refund me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I asked, if I pay with cash, you give me a gift card, then I have to buy the gift card myself and send the product to your warehouse in Germany, this is not just buying a product!",
    "I have been talking to customer service about this issue, who is responsible for this problem, the customer service did not say anything, they did not dare to take any responsibility, what kind of after-sales service is this? One word: take responsibility! But I guess Amazon will not give me a chance to publish this review, they will just delete it!",
    "The quality is good, 5 stars, but the logistics is bad.",
    "1. The quality is good, it kills instantly, the price is reasonable, and it is worth the money.",
    "2. Solid, enough materials, welding is firm, surface processing is appropriate, color is good.",
    "3. Logistics is a hardcore, the single that came down from the 3rd floor, the 11th floor arrived.",
    "4. If Amazon didn't mark the delivery date as February 7th, I would be very happy.",
    "5, but with an estimated delivery time, it is a promise to the user, and when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is not happy.",
    "6. If you don't have a good grasp of the situation, don't make a promise.",
    "seven, in fact, i care a lot about what the merchants promise.",
    "I got a low score because I was number 8.",
    "the gold leaf is fading",
    "It does work, but whether it is obvious depends on the person or the psychological effect.",
    "The only thing that is not good is the gold line. It looks good when it is designed, but the gold line will fade, and if you put it on the car, and you touch it a few times, you will have some gold powder on your hand and on the car.",
    "I hope the product can be improved.",
    "This square shape doesn't have any decorative effect, so don't put gold lines on it, otherwise it will get dirty when it falls on the car.",
    "The item is in good condition, the speed is good, and it can be packaged in two packages.",
    "The speed is quite fast, but it is divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, and the anti-seismic is too much, with thick paper pasted on and wrapped in plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to disassemble, which is similar to a domestic express box, and a few cushioning airbags are put in, which seems to be a little too simple.",
    "yalan bedding is not bad",
    "The mattress of 34cm is not ordinary thick, you can sleep directly on the bed without the mattress.",
    "The quality is good, both sides are soft, sleep is very comfortable, and I fall asleep quickly when lying on it.",
    "The bed base arrived with two small marks on it due to the courier being a bit rough, but the customer service at Yarra were very responsible and efficient in resolving the issue.",
    "It's not a self-produced product, Amazon is not embarrassed.",
    "The page is clearly marked as self-operated, but the goods are actually delivered by the supplier, and the after-sales service is provided by the supplier. If there is any problem, please contact the supplier directly.",
    "Sorry, your order has been sent to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; sorry, your return has been successful on Amazon, sorry, no one will help you, you need to contact the supplier for a return.",
    "This is a self-sufficient product.",
    "The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and the after-sales service of Amazon does not take responsibility, and the customer service even said \"I will help you contact the supplier\", and claimed that it was self-operated, which is too shameless, it is a shameless act of cheating consumers!",
    "the experience of depression",
    "The filter I bought from another website works well, and there is no water stains after 28 days.",
    "Because the quality of things bought from Amazon has always been good, I wanted to buy it here this time, the first time I bought a filter from Amazon, I felt it was not good, not only did it start to have water stains early on, but the filter was also used for 28 days, and there were floating black carbon powder, I don't know if I should continue to use it or throw it away, it's really uncomfortable~",
    "it's not as good as you think.",
    "Compared to the power strips I have used before, the external workmanship is generally good, but I have not disassembled the internal structure, but I hope it is as described by the store, from the convenience of use, whether each independent unit is powered on or off is missing a display.",
    "The package was damaged, so we will check the quality of the product at the time.",
    "The outer packaging was damaged more seriously, the inner packaging seemed to be new, but the instruction manual was not new, it was installed in September, and there were some goods in the warehouse, I hope it will not be bad later, please explain why several customers mentioned the damaged packaging, but you can handle it safely, thank you!",
    "it's not bad, but there are some small problems.",
    "Bought my first filter jug, read a few reviews and felt that LAICA had a better price/performance ratio so I went with this one.  Received it and followed the instructions to put the filter in, tried it out and overall I think it's fine, but when pouring water it seems that the original water mixes with the processed water (the original water is not sealed very well).",
    "When you use it, make sure you wait until all the water has been filtered before you pour it out!",
    "image incomplete",
    "The picture doesn't show the details on the side, which are not consistent with the main style, there is a big difference, this is one of them; This pearl is from Thailand, but there is no indication of origin, this is the second; There is no indication of the soil, this is the third; When I bought it in the UK, it was clearly in a box for each piece, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo",
    "Be careful when buying things, especially those from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is really bad",
    "I ordered two days ago and received it today, and found that it was 40 yuan cheaper than the original price. I spent a lot of time to find the customer service, but the customer service said that they could not refund the difference, but could buy it again and refund.",
    "The customer experience and service of this company is ten times better than that of some other companies.",
    "it's okay, as a newcomer, it's worth it.",
    "The quality is acceptable, but it's not as good as the top-tier gold, I've seen the price of that in the market, it's several hundred, I've never played gold, it's okay.",
    "it's not bad.",
    "The product is good, I bought it for my girlfriend, but I was not happy at noon when I was not at Canada Post, the shipping company directly put the package in the mailbox and sent me a message to confirm that the package was not picked up, so I had to run twice.",
    "but it's not bad.",
    "worth buying",
    "The little monkey is cute, the discount of Amazon is really big, and the official website of Zhou Sheng Sheng directly delivers, and I ordered it last night, and I received it this afternoon, it is really fast.",
    "The postman is also very responsible.",
    "yeah!",
    "A customer's confession",
    "1. You receive this kind of junk, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, they will contact you within 54 hours.",
    "2. Then you contact the customer service, they will tell you that there will be a specialist to handle this problem, and he will tell you the result.",
    "You will never be able to contact this officer directly, you don't know her badge number, and there is no direct line to call her. You can only be contacted by her.",
    "The three tragedies are that I waited for nearly three days, this officer contacted me, and my phone was away, and I didn't receive the officer's call.",
    "I waited 2 hours and never got a call back from the specialist, during that time I called Amazon customer service and emailed them asking them to call me back.",
    "It's been almost 3 days since I received the defective coffee machine from Amazon, and I still don't know what they will do about it!",
    "The products of Amazon USA are fine, but the shopping method is good, but the service is far worse than that of Amazon in the US.",
    "for me, i can only continue to wait...",
    "unstable ground",
    "Because the reviews on the website were good, I was looking forward to this pan, and when I got it, I liked it because it was light. But when I started cooking, I found that the bottom of the pan was not flat, it was raised in the middle and sunk in around the edges, and the oil ran to the edges. I bought a big piece of pork belly to fry, but I couldn't cover the central area with oil, and it was a",
    "I don't know if it's my bad luck, I just got a pot that is not flat, fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it.",
    "I cleaned the pot thoroughly and worked hard for half a day.",
    "Good product design requires matching manufacturing skills to be realized",
    "This is a very simple design.",
    "The cube's design features a slightly curved top.",
    "it should have been a very smooth line.",
    "Unfortunately, the final result could not be achieved.",
    "Because the top has two parts, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water tank cover.",
    "The radius of the top and the control panel are inconsistent, and there is a height difference of up to 2mm when they are assembled.",
    "although it looks like a small hole.",
    "But it can be said that the whole design concept has been destroyed.",
    "I feel a little sorry for the product designer.",
    "It seems that the product manager of Apple is not capable of making such a product.",
    "(The after-sales service is not expected to be too high, but when I heard the after-sales service say that all the units of this product are like this, not just the one I bought, her indifferent and honest attitude made me understand that I can't expect too much of the appearance.",
    "It's very cheap after the discount, but Amazon's false discount is heartbreaking",
    "Buy a baby carrier for your baby when he/she is born, it is super warm.",
    "The outside of the pot is not hot, so it can effectively protect the temperature from escaping and will not burn people.",
    "The air conditioner can still maintain a high temperature after a night.",
    "Amazon said there were 320 discounts for the anniversary, but I found that everyone had 249,289,299, I suddenly felt cheated, but when I went to the supermarket to compare prices, I found that the price of the same brand was still cheaper, so I will bring it with me when I go out in the future.",
    "Vitamix Vita-Mix 6300",
    "I have been looking at it for a long time, and I saw that the price of the Meizu M6300 was discounted, and the price of the Middle East was the same as the domestic price, so I bought it quickly.",
    "Ordered on September 2nd, expected delivery on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, which is about 10 days earlier, the speed is really fast!",
    "The box is not big, I used the original packaging of Vitamix, and Amazon is not afraid of the broken package that fell into the sea!",
    "The machine looks new, all the parts are there, but the cup on the base is so dangerous, I'm afraid the cup will fly out when I turn on the machine!",
    "I asked a friend who has 5200, and he described it as not being as loose as it seems.",
    "The English recipe that comes with the random is quite tiring, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online, which is quite troublesome!",

    "It's too small, no umbrella, and the material is ordinary.",
    "It's not a large size!",
    "The second Totes: 1. No umbrella sleeve 2. Umbrella handle material is average 3. It says Large but it is a compact umbrella that is good for one person, two people might be a little cramped.",
    "In fact, the one I bought in America can accommodate three people without pressure.",
    "i don't feel good.",
    "First, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms when you press it. Second, the design of the flat surface on the back of the box does not prevent the ABS from scratching the box surface. Third, the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around the handle and the handle is protruding. There are many things that are not satisfactory, and the cable is not smooth.",
    "PS: The wheel feels really good",
    "i can still do it.",
    "Pros: The backpack is more compact and looks durable.",
    "The downside: The 2D code on the card cannot be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook cannot be put in (it is a little longer), this backpack with double shoulder straps can be locked, but it does not prepare a lock for the buyer, it is not very considerate.",
    "It's okay overall, I don't know if it's real leather",
    "The overall feeling is okay, I don't know if it's real leather, so I can't make a random evaluation.",
    "It can hold A4 size documents, up to 80 pages thick, but the box is too thick and rigid to estimate it can hold it.",
    "The bag is soft, and the inner bag is also more humanized, and it is still quite good.",
    "I just got a bottom with a little sandy eye, is it because of my bad character?",
    "I don't want to go back and forth to exchange it, so I endured it.",
    "Overall, I would rate it 4 stars, it is worth it.",
    "ForRoyal is popular all over the world. Camera strap. Single camera strap.",
    "The design of the shoulder strap is more scientific, it is easy to wear, and the camera is fixed and protected by soft materials in the chest, unlike other quick-shooting guns that fix the bottom of the camera with screws, and it is very convenient to take off the camera.",
    "Garbage after-sales service",
    "I bought a piano from Amazon about half a month ago, but it was missing a part. After I notified them, they gave me a call for after-sales service. After several communications, I still haven't received the part. What is the efficiency!",
    "The repair after the problem is estimated to be more troublesome, so the friends who bought it are still around the road, too much trouble!",
    "it's not bad, but there's a little flaw.",
    "The koto has a flaw, one corner is missing, so it feels like a second-rate one, but the price is not bad, and the sound of the koto is also not bad.",
    "it's okay, i'll do it.",
    "I have been using it for a long time, except for the low voice, the overall performance is not bad.",
    "It wasn't as perfect as I imagined.",
    "The first time I bought it, the product had problems, all the lights were flashing and it couldn't be used.",
    "I asked for a replacement, but it still hasn't arrived in Shanghai after three days.",
    "The phone was not answered even when they were delivering.",
    "They said that's the only way they can contact them.",
    "Amazon can't find a place to appeal.",
    "I didn't ask for it, but somehow it was delivered late, as I requested - this text message came.",
    "What else did he say about the transfer?",
    "At least a terrible shopping experience makes you question the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.",
    "I don't think I'll get it today.",
    "The label is not sticky enough and not waterproof.",
    "Although Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof and the surface does not have a coating; the adhesiveness of the label is poor, and it is not suitable for use as a cable label, it is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy it to organize cables need to pay attention.",
    "The pen is fine, but the packaging is too simple, just a paper box, with no protective measures, and the pen box is sealed with a large piece of transparent tape, which will tear off the tape when you tear it off.",

    "but the pen is fine.",

    "I don't have the quality to write, I'd rather write 925-25.",
    "I would like to praise TNT for their fast delivery, the package arrived in a very short time, and the service attitude is also very good!",
    "I've been using 925-25 for a long time, it's great. I just got 925-85, the pen's weight is not mentioned, the style is very beautiful, I give it 4 stars because the pen is a little heavy, it is not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the graphite core a little shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable",
    "so they became amazon fanatics.",
    "The kids didn't like the pens that were bought at a super discount.",
    "It has been sealed, and when I applied for a refund, they even offered to deliver it to me for free.",
    "that's awesome.",

    "I bought a purple one that looked good, but when I opened it today, I felt it was not right. The sound was too loud and too soft at the same time.",
    "At first, I thought the reason for the sound effect of this song was not worth thinking about, but after listening for half an hour, I found that this problem was very serious, not only the pronunciation was wrong, but also the low sound effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise, was it only my purple one that had this problem? Or was the earphone manufacturing technology really not good enough now?",
    "Terrible review, very disappointing.",

    "4.The whole machine is biased towards the compressor end, and it is very difficult to move.",
    "It feels like a Sony entry-level machine, just the workmanship, made in Malaysia.",
    "I feel that Sony should be better than Xiaomi in China's OEM.",
    "5. The machine is very hot, the temperature of the two channels used for watching movies is about 40-50\u00b0C after 2 hours of covering with hands, I don't know if it is because the compressor is too large and the heat is too much.",
    "Nowadays, most people use a switch power supply, and this big voltage regulator is estimated to be about 4kg.",

    "i want to cut it open and see what's inside.",
    "I thought about it later, if it was disappointing after opening, it was too much money; if it was satisfying after opening, it was difficult to put it back together, and it was not fun to use it.",
    "Forget it, even if Sony used a good chip.",
    "As for the details of the power, it will make ordinary people dizzy.",

    "I was surprised, the sound quality was 3D surround!",
    "I asked in a physical communication store, it's around 30 yuan, but it's not a branded product, it's a random product, so I say that the price of this brand is 27 yuan, but the value is absolutely worth it!",
    "Worst online shopping experience",
    "After placing an order on September 28th, the system showed that the order had been shipped, but it wasn't until October 12th that the package was finally received.",
    "I asked the seller for the tracking number of the order, but the seller did not provide it, so I couldn't find the order.",
    "So I emailed the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number and haven't heard back for two days.",
    "In the end, I called Amazon customer service, and the customer service told me the seller's phone number. I called the store again, and after a few times, the phone was connected. I was told that the package was lost, and I could immediately send a new one.",
    "Although I am in a hurry, I didn't say much to the seller, just give it to me right away.",
    "So I called the next day to ask if it had been shipped.",
    "The seller said it will be shipped in the afternoon.",
    "I called again in the afternoon and the seller said it would be sent, but it wouldn't be sent until 5 or 6 pm, but when I called at 7 pm, no one answered.",
    "I asked again in the morning of the third day, have you sent out the goods?",
    "can you tell me the order number?",
    "The seller said he didn't have it, and told me to order it from another store if I was in a hurry, or he would send it to me in the afternoon if I could wait.",
    "No way, I have to wait for a long time to order from another store.",
    "All we can do is beg the seller to ship it as soon as possible.",

    "As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it's for someone else, I'll add a comment later.",
    "I just bought it half a year ago and used it a few times, but now it's not working well. Can it be repaired?",
    "I bought it because I had a laptop, but I didn't use it much after that.",
    "I just bring it when I travel.",
    "Recently, I found that when I plugged in the charger, it wouldn't charge unless I gently pushed the connection between the charger and the phone back and forth with my hands.",
    "Suspected interface contact, can it be repaired now?",
    "Amazon should stop using EMS!",
    "The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.",
    "I don't know why Yemen needs to send EMS, it's a bad habit in the industry, but at least computers are valuable items!",
    "The delivery date shown on the order was the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!",
    "From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why does it take 4 or 5 days?",
    "The courier finally arrived in Fuzhou at 22:00 in the morning, and I was very happy to receive the goods. However, in the evening, I didn't receive any calls or messages, and when I checked the courier, it had already been signed for at noon, and it showed that I had signed for it!",

    "who am i? where am i? is this computer really mine?",
    "I'm starting to doubt the meaning of life!",
    "I finally got my computer back after one last run to pick up the payment.",
    "The reason is simple, the courier mixed up the two order numbers, but at least the package was not lost.",
    "I strongly recommend Amazon to stop using EMS. If Amazon uses EMS for shipping in the future, I will never buy from them again.",
    "it's not bad.",
    "First, I bought it a few days ago and found it was cheaper, bad reviews, but the price-performance ratio is high, the CPU and GPU are enough to handle mainstream online games and a part of large single-machine games, the cooling is very good, but the screen is a little bright (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not good, the hard drive is not good (I recommend you to add a solid state drive yourself), I went to the",

    "The quality of the hard drive is very good, the price-performance ratio is absolutely high, it is cheaper to buy it than in Hong Kong, and I absolutely recommend buying it if you don't have to use it urgently and can tolerate shipping.",
    "But it has to be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same, and it has not improved since I swore that I would never use it a few years ago. You can never find out the real logistics situation, and the information is always sent a few weeks later, and it can never be sued, this is the bureaucracy!",
    "The goods have been received for several days, but the logistics information still says that you will receive the goods in 10 days!",
    "logistics is not a trivial matter",
    "It was delivered like this, not only the packaging was crushed, but the electrical appliance was also opened, and I don't know if it was tampered with.",
    "FYI",

    "I looked it up online, it might be a common problem with water getting in, and there's no warranty.",
    "i'm so depressed!",
    "Now that I have wrapped it in a protective film, how long should I continue to use it?",
    "bought a used one.",
    "It's a lot of machines, so 100% tax is a bit high, but now that there are over 600, it's more balanced.",
    "When I received it, the state of the tape seal was not good, it seemed to have been opened, I took a photo quickly, and it was torn open when I opened it, the paper inside was also damaged, I was afraid it was someone else's return, I gave it to my husband before the anniversary, but the machine didn't have any electricity, thank goodness there was no beard in the blade, otherwise, how could I return it!",
    "It is unknown whether it is good to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term, as the previous reviews have pointed out, the things that are issued when there is a shortage are really not reliable!",

    "I can't tell if Amazon's inventory is fake or if they're just shipping me an employee.",
    "I will buy it again, if it is fake, I will find the people responsible.",

    "The shoe size is a little larger, 25cm long and 10.5cm wide, the shoe is a little wider, but I like to wear a little wider shoes, and the shoes are just right.",
    "Secondly, the quality control of the shoes is really not good. One of the soles is damaged, and the other has various scratches and a needle eye, and the rubber strip connecting the sole and the upper is misaligned, and it is obvious that the quality is not good!",
    "I regret it!",
    "I bought it for 280 yuan when I was doing activities, which is quite reasonable for Asus, and there are lower prices in the reviews.",
    "Now let's talk about shoes. The advantages are: the shoes are light, running is quite comfortable, and they fit well, they won't fall apart easily.",
    "The color is great but the downside is obvious: I usually wear a size 40, but this time I bought a size 40.5, and there is about 1 inch of space between my toes and the front of the shoe, but it doesn't affect anything.",

The after-sales service is very thoughtful, the attitude of the customer service is very friendly and polite, and the problem is handled patiently and efficiently. The perfect solution after the problem is solved, the delivery is very convenient and reliable, and the delivery man is very thoughtful of the customer. He always reminds me to pick up",

    "The product, I tried it out, it's not bad.",
    "but I have never bought such a product before, so I can't compare!",
    "size, logistics",

    "I received a package yesterday, bought from Amazon, marked as EMS, and finally delivered by Tianma Express. How many turns did it make? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tianma Express not good?",
    "I'll say it again, the packaging is just a few layers of shrink wrap, no plastic bubble wrap, and when you open it, all the parts are just sitting in an empty box, the toy quality is fine, no broken parts, but it's smaller than I expected, because it doesn't have a battery, it's hard to push around, and the track is too wide, the design is not good.",

They replied \"yes\", so why is the time difference so much, it must be the watch is not accurate, simply said it is a water product, not what I said difficult to hear, look, it is very obvious quality problem (the number display is not complete) all of them are sold, is it a garbage.",
    "I contacted the seller, who gave me a bunch of reasons and even complained that they shouldn't have sold me the item in the first place. This product, this seller, this after-sales service, no one will dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.",

    "It is definitely the genuine one. I went to the counter to check the authenticity of the watch. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it is imported mechanical watch core. So it is worth it. It is not comparable to the so-called mechanical watches of 300-400 yuan. This is a genuine and reasonable price.",

    "I just bought a new one, so I want to cancel my Amazon order.",
    "Since the order was placed at midnight, it was impossible to receive the express delivery in the morning, so I called the customer service at 7:30 to cancel the order, and the customer service replied that the order had been cancelled and I should wait for the SMS notification.",

My home router is TP, and I searched online and found that many people have this problem. I spent more than 2 hours to change the router settings. Finally, I used 360WIFI as a medium to make it work. During this period, I called the Mi customer service, and they also had no solution to this problem, so they just",

    "When I bought this phone, I thought of two feelings at that time. I still feel the same way, but now I can't look back. Maybe life is like this. Some people don't want to meet some people all their lives, and some things they don't want to know all their lives. But what can we do?",
    "Every time I see a Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain comes flooding back, filling me up. I\u2019ve never regretted spending more than 2000 yuan on a phone, but I didn\u2019t hesitate to buy one for her.

    "That's why I chose Huawei.",
    "I've had it for over half a year, and it's been great. It's really good.",
    "The reason for not giving it a full score is that once when using the offline navigation, it showed a loss of position, which I never found the cause for, but it worked fine otherwise.",
    "And it has a built-in online input function, which automatically designs a route after searching the destination. When it leaves wifi and starts to navigate, it automatically disconnects from the network and navigates itself, which is very useful. It doesn't need to run data, and it can position and navigate directly by communicating with satellites, which is great!",
