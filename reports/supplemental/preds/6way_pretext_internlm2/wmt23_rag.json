    "I recommend the product, but you might be better off buying it elsewhere.",
    "i'm worried about your strength, but for now",
    "I bought a new lid because the old one was falling apart.",
    "It does its job of keeping the lid stable, but because it's a fancy plastic product, it makes a nasty sound like 'mekeke (it's about to break)' when you open and close the lid.",
    "You have to choose something that fits the thickness of the lid, so you have to be careful when you buy it.",
    "I love the cute paw bag",
    "I was looking for a backpack to take my dog out, and I was attracted to this stylish gray backpack, so I bought it here.",
    "It was a buildable style, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so I felt that it wasn't that heavy.",
    "but some of them might make a tiny step.",
    "I think it will be fun even if it takes a long time to move.",
    "it folds in thirds. it's a very simple pattern",
    "Even if you fold it up, it looks like a meatball, and it's cute when you put it down.",
    "Light and comfortable!",
    "and about 3,000 pulleys.",
    "First, I was attracted by the appearance and the low price, so I immediately bought it!",
    "I've had a TSA lock for a few years now and I love it, it's so convenient.",
    "and as a lost key expert, i recommend number lock.",
    "I just put the lightness as the most important point, but if you want to be durable and secure, the fastener is a bit weak, so if you cut it with a knife, it will break in an instant.",
    "Also, the fastener's matching is weak so I want to overlap the work.",
    "If you're overseas, I recommend bringing it on the plane.",
    "I used it on the shinkansen and it was comfortable.",
    "I can't decide on the size...",
    "I have a hard time buying shoes because of the wide range of sizes.",
    "Convers and Banz are wearing 24cm.",
    "MRL996\u308224cm\u3002",
    "I thought it was uncomfortable at first, but I got used to it.",
    "This time's ML574 was tough for my sister to wear 24.5cm, but she wore it and it was really tough.",
    "It felt like my little finger was touching it.",
    "So I bought the 25cm one.",
    "i opened it and it was too big...",
    "I tried putting them on and they were a little loose even with socks.",
    "I was thinking about returning it, but if it's still uncomfortable at 24.5, I'll put an insole in and wear it at 25.",
    "I bought team led and it's a very nice bright red!",
    "I wear a lot of black and white monochrome clothes, so I wear these to brighten up my look!",
    "165\u339d\u300140\u4ee3\u7537\u6027",

    "",
    "i'm fixing the part that got messed up while i'm swimming.",
    "Especially if you're slacking off on your juggie, you'll get a big belly.",
    "Also, if you walk while moving your hips up and down violently, you will be pulled down.",
    "",
    "at this price, this is a good deal, but i think you'll be more satisfied if you buy a smaller size.",
    "i guess it was a gas leak after all...",
    "Silver Colt 25 was leaking gas, when I changed the valve there was a problem where part of the tank was missing, but when I used [Buss Bond Q] to seal the tank and did a repair upgrade it worked well, if you want to buy this Colt 25, I would ask someone who can disassemble and assemble it, or if you can't take pictures while disassembling it, I can't recommend it much, if it breaks, it's fun",
    "i thought it would be of a certain quality, but",
    "you can use the quick return and torque when you need to.",
    "I prefer light and small, but most of all, I like simplicity without pretense.",
    "There is no gap when attaching the bit, and I thought it was a great Cospa for 188 yen.",
    "The durability is the only thing I'm worried about.",
    "I don't use it that often, but I think it's something that can be put in a toolbox.",
    "I bought it together with the same seller's \"1/4 inch hexagonal magnetic quick release driver, roll, bit holder 60/100/150 mm\".",
    "I had no problems with it, and it was a pretty good deal for the price.",
    "the controller stops moving.",
    "If you don't do it right, the plane will fly on its own and you won't be able to control it.",
    "If you reconnect the cable, you can operate it, but after a few minutes, it will move in an unexpected direction and you won't be able to operate it anymore.",
    "I don't recommend buying this product.",
    "i should warn you all.",
    "I love this product.",
    "I recommend the wired controller for the BEBONCOOL PS3.",
    "It's reliable, and I've been using it for a long time without it breaking.",

    "I can't solve the problem.",
    "Also, when giving tools to the parents, I just point to the screen and tell them to do it, but I tried it myself and it didn't go smoothly no matter how many times I tried.",
    "Well, it might be easier to get rid of it for people who are used to DS.",
    "I can't really get into the illustrations of manga characters, or at least I don't think I do. I think I get into the fun of the screen, like with DS, but for some reason I can't get into it.",
    "The way of calculation is also like a race against time, for example, how many questions can be answered in how many minutes.",
    "I understand that you want to hurry up with the exam, but... can't you just calm down and do the calculations?",
    "I don't like the gong that rings when it's over.",

    "Listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "Persona3's characters were the first to be HD-ized, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.",
    "I thought that Shunpei looked like a handsome man (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it's not fresh... I think that 3 is more enjoyable when I think like that.",
    "As a music game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is blue, but it was hard to see against a dark background.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even when it's overlaid on the background.",
    "Because it has a lot of assist functions, I think even people who are bad at rhythm games can play it.",
    "Sound game experts can make the challenge function a difficult game.",
    "Triple Pack has a Santora, but it's not just a bonus, it's a solid 4 pack, so if you like Persona's tunes, I recommend this one.",
    "i'm sorry",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the photo, but the actual thing is a bit bluish, but closer to black or charcoal gray.",
    "and it wasn't a double buckle.",
    "So I was thinking of buying gold too, but I'm still thinking about it. I'll give up if the price is low.",
    "I received an apology and a new item from the seller after the review was posted.",
    "the processing after that was also quick.",
    "I think the response was very good even for inexpensive items.",

    "But it's not a double lock buckle, the difference is clear from the explanation photo.",
    "that's the only thing i regret.",
    "i won't be able to come this evening.",
    "I used it on my SIM free iPhone7s.",
    "At first, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing the SIM card, so I asked and learned from a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport (set it from settings>mobile communication>communication options to turn on data roaming).",
    "The theories attached to the product didn't seem to matter much...",
    "However, the reception of mobile phone in the area of Gimpo Airport is poor, so I have been using 3G all the time.",
    "When I went out to the city, it became 4G.",
    "In the evening and at night, the communication sometimes became very heavy, but now I think it may have reached the limit of 100MB per day.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I used Softbank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim-free Ymobile, and when Z4 started to malfunction, I was looking for a used Xperia to buy when I found this phone that I could use with a new SIM card.",
    "I used the mobile Suica, so I was worried if I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.",
    "I got a bigger size, heavier, and silver so it looks like an iPhone 6?",
    "I don't play games, so the processing speed is still the same as Z4, and it feels a little faster. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition was slow, but it took a little time to recognize it. Therefore, I use this because face recognition is faster.",
    "I thought it was great like the iPhone, and I was able to buy a phone that satisfied me even though I got an Android with version 9.",
    "i'm here to talk about that report you made."
