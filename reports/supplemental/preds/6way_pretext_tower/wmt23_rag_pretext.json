    "But I think it's a good idea merchant.",
    "for the price",
    "You shouldn't expect quality from these products.",
    "One of the flower markings had been crushed.",
    "I think the size is just right.",
    "I think people with thick skin are probably tough.",
    "Maybe they should have bought a plain one.",
    "i don't know",
    "The design is good but it's big and I'm wondering if it's still effective if I put it on my feet?",
    "It's winter in the Tohoku region...",
    "As mentioned in other reviews, the electric heating wire is only 110 x 80 and the placement is not vertical but horizontal.",
    "I bought it because I wanted to heat the whole futon and it was more expensive than the futon blanket but I never regretted it, but I wonder if it's okay that I can't confirm it at the store like a famous brand.",
    "You can only use it in combination with hot water bottles and N-warm tori.",
    "Incidentally, the quality of the blanket is not in question.",
    "it's good",
    "Small size and enough airflow.",
    "The battery can also be replaced with a spare.",
    "If you place it on a desk and adjust the angle, it looks like a photo.",
    "It's on a desk and blows away with its own wind, but you can lay a handkerchief over it.",
    "The sound, if you use it outside/in a restaurant etc, you won't even notice it's on \"medium\", but if you use it in an office, it's too loud even on \"small\".",
    "You need to be strict with yourself and only use it when you're going out.",
    "Also, when using it in the office, even on the \"small\" setting it blows too much air and is too cold.",
    "It's perfect for the scene where you're sweating and you run to the family restaurant and turn it on to \"large\" to cool down all at once.",
    "Just one thing, when you throw it in your bag, sometimes the power button gets pressed and it turns on without you knowing.",
    "You can try to push the button a little bit (or push it in) to make it harder to push the button, or you can try to push it down for a longer time.",
    "It's a necessary item in times of extreme heat that can be life threatening, so it's good to have a better one.",
    "Multi-functional light speaker",
    "I have it in the weakest warm color and I use it in my bedroom.",
    "it's better than you think!",
    "I'm glad I bought it.",
    "As a light, it is touch-controlled and can adjust brightness and color.",
    "The white color goes with any room and the color light changes in gradation so it's pretty.",
    "Also, you can touch the place you like and it will stop at your favorite color, so you can light it up to your mood!",
    "It's LED so you can expect it to last a long time.",
    "In terms of sound quality, I think it's a level that is satisfactory enough for my amateur ears.",
    "Also, the great thing about this light is that it is very versatile.",
    "\u2022 There is a large speaker on the top.",
    "It can be paired with a mobile phone or other device via Bluetooth, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.",
    "\u30fbWhen paired with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.",
    "\u2022 It also supports MicroSD, so you can connect it to your computer and use it as an mp3 player.",

    "He started to challenge DTM at the age of 66 to prevent bokeh.",
    "I purchased the audio interface and the main unit.",
    "I started with programming, but got into piano playing and now I practice every day until late at night.",
    "I downloaded some free piano samples and I use them for my piano practice, as I downloaded ASIO at first but the free piano samples sounded better.",
    "I think it was a good buy.",
    "I feel like I've been fooled by the looks.",
    "What are the products that are worth buying?",
    "It's a long post.",
    "I have been using a Doshisha office chair (armrest chair with a lift) for 4-5 years and the synthetic leather has deteriorated and become bubbly, so I am considering purchasing a chair with a lift and a non-synthetic leather.",
    "I've been looking around home centres and furniture stores but I can't find anything suitable.",
    "I'm a bit worried that I won't be able to see the actual product, but I've compromised on the design and price and bought this product on Amazon.",
    "The box is surprisingly light and compact.",
    "There is one spare in the box.",
    "[Attention] The hex wrench and screws that come with it are oily.",
    "At first, I was annoyed when I noticed that the wrench was white and had oil on it.",
    "Completed assembly in 40 minutes.",
    "Finished and checked the product.",
    "The armrests that can be raised and lowered are different in terms of how hard they are to raise and lower, and the left armrest is heavier and the right armrest is lighter, which makes the armrests difficult to use (there is no way to adjust them).",
    "The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and it drops quickly with a \"clunk\" sound.",
    "The seat is hard and uncomfortable (does it have low elasticity?",
    ")The backrest part of the competition mesh is harder than other companies' mesh chairs and is thin, so it hurts the back.",
    "The small details are that the height from the seat to the ground is 530 instead of 550 (the height from the seat to the ground is important for tall people) and the legs that support the casters are not made of steel, so durability is questionable.",
    "I have bought a separate cushion and I use a towel to cover the mesh fabric as it seems to wear out quickly.",
    "I felt that the back fit was good for me, who is 186cm and 80kg, but I felt that the product was not satisfactory, and I felt that it was a product that was not worth buying.",
    "Maybe it's better to see the office chairs in person before purchasing.",
    "I received a greeting email from the manufacturer, so I'll ask about the armrest and headrest.",
    "yeah,i'm weighing things.",
    "Well, what do you think of this?",
    "I bought a Pixel 4K tuner for a reasonable price as I didn't expect much from the environment of my home and it seems like the right-handed BS4K is visible.",
    "As an experiment, I have been watching the free right-handed broadcasts, starting with NHK BS4K, and I can watch it beautifully on my Panasonic 4K TV that I bought at the same time.",
    "(Sometimes the image jumps) After purchase, the update came right away and it is compatible with recording, so I have made a few reservations and watched them, but I wonder if the external 2.5 inch HDD also affects the playback, because sometimes the image stops, or the frame skips.",
    "The user interface is not praised either, and I am satisfied with \"I can see 4K broadcasts\".",
    "By the way, when you are recording, you can only play the program you are recording, so I also accept this as a plus feature that the HDD can record in 4K.",
    "You might be disappointed if you buy it with high expectations, so don't expect too much.",
    "I hope it will be improved with the update.",
    "The heating function is OK",
    "I only used the heating function, but it took about 2 hours to warm up and 2.5 hours to get hot.",
    "I have used it in the passenger footwell of a compact car, and I do notice the fan noise when idle, but I don't notice it at all when driving.",
    "Also, because it's new, I was concerned about the chemical smell that was being emitted by the fan, so I had to open the window regularly to let in some fresh air.",
    "As another review has stated, the bar across the shoulder strap is terrible, so you need to bend it with a negative driver or something.",
    "they're just so, so delicate.",
    "I started using it today and it broke after 2 months.",
    "I liked the feel and size of the keys but it's not worth breaking.",
    "I work with video editing all day and my PC randomly goes to 100% volume.",
    "It goes down to 0% in a split second.",
    "I can't use headphones because it hurts my ears and I can't use my PC at night because of the low volume.",
    "It sends out signals every few seconds and the volume display will flicker on and off the computer screen.",
    "Furthermore, the keyboard interferes with the mouse's instructions, so you can't use the mouse freely unless you turn the keyboard off.",
    "The enter key and backspace key also stopped working.",
    "I would not recommend it at all, but if you have 1000 yen, you can try buying it.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use it for half a year.",
    "Other companies offer the same price range with a warranty of 1 year to 3 years, but this one only offers a warranty of 6 months.",
    "The short warranty period speaks to the fragility of the product.",
    "The product is the best, the packaging is the worst",
    "I love the product, it's my favorite.",
    "I would like to recommend the Hood Stocker to anyone looking for one!",
    "However, there was a lot of space between the large cardboard boxes and they were packed very poorly, with no packing list.",
    "The box was opened and the lid was off.",
    "I would recommend the product but you might want to look elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the strength but I'll try",
    "I bought it because the lid was not strong enough to support it.",
    "It does its job in terms of stability, but it's a flimsy plastic product and if you're not careful when opening and closing the lid it makes a really annoying \"crinkle crinkle (it's going to break)\" sound.",
    "As you can't choose the thickness of the lid, you need to be careful when you buy it.",
    "Cute little paw back",
    "I was looking for a bag to take my dog out in and I was drawn to this grey bag which is why I bought it.",
    "It's a kit and when you hold it, it's surprisingly light so it's not too heavy to carry.",
    "The zipper also moves smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "It's also comfortable for long travels.",
    "It's very compact and easy to fold.",
    "It's cute even when folded and the design of the meatballs is visible.",
    "Light and comfortable!",
    "The pulleys are also easy to use.",
    "First of all, I was immediately attracted by the appearance and low price, so I bought it!",
    "I've had a few TSA locks for a few years and they're really handy.",
    "And as a master of forgetting or losing keys, I highly recommend the number lock.",
    "However, I do place the most importance on lightness, so I would say that if you want durability and security, then the zipper is a weak point, it takes a week to get through the zipper, and it tears in a second if you cut it with a knife.",
    "Also, the snaps are a bit soft so I would like to see some overlapping effort.",
    "For overseas, I would recommend carrying it on as hand luggage.",
    "I have used it on shinkansen trips and it was comfortable.",
    "It's hard to choose the size...",
    "I have a wide foot and it's a struggle to find shoes.",
    "I wear 24cm in converse and bangs.",
    "MRL996 is also 24cm.",
    "At first I thought it was hard, but I got used to it.",
    "My sister said that the ML574 was too narrow for her at 24.5cm, and she was right.",
    "I felt the little finger hit.",
    "So I bought 25cm.",
    "I received it and opened it, it's big...",
    "I tried them on and they are a bit loose even with socks on.",
    "I was wondering if I should return it, but since it's a hassle to return it, I'm going to wear it with the 25cm inserts.",
    "I bought the team red and it's a great bright red!",
    "Since there are many monochrome outfits in black and white, wearing these will make you look brighter!",
    "165cm, 40s male",
    "I ordered the right size but I would recommend the M size for the following style",
    "Height: 165 cm  Weight: 60 kg  Waist: 81 cm  Belly: 100 cm  Typical metabo belly.",
    "<Used> Underwater, the waist area is loose, and the rush guard comes up.",
    "she's swimming while fixing the part that came loose.",
    "Especially when I'm not paying attention in the jacuzzi, my metabo belly is very visible.",
    "Also, when walking while vigorously moving up and down, the bottom will come up again.",
    "<Product Design> The fabric is durable and not too thin, so there's no need to worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "At this price and with this construction, I'm satisfied, but I think the smaller size is more fitting.",
    "I guess I had a gas leak...",
    "Silver Colt 25 has a gas leak, I had to replace the valve, and it has given me the chance to take-up this great opportunity.  I have to say that I don't recommend this gun to anyone who doesn't know how to disassemble it, because it's not easy.  I have to say that I don't recommend this gun to anyone who doesn't know how to disassemble it, because it's not",
    "I thought it was 188 yen, but what kind of quality is it?",
    "You can use the early crank and torque when needed.",
    "It's light, small, and simple, which is what I like.",
    "There is no gata when you attach the bit, and I thought this was a surprisingly expensive cospa for 188 yen.",
    "How durable it is, I guess.",
    "I don't know how often you'll use it, but I think it's a good thing to have in your toolbox.",
    "I bought this along with the 1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release driver bit holder 60/100/150mm from the same seller.",
    "This one is also fine, I'd say it's pretty good for the price.",
    "The controller stops working.",
    "The controller will randomly move the player and you can't control it.",
    "If you reconnect the cable, you can operate it, but after a few minutes, the machine will move in the wrong direction and you will not be able to operate it.",
    "Don't buy this product.",
    "I'll warn you all.",
    "This is a terrible product.",
    "It's wired, but I would recommend the controller for the BEBONCOOL PS3.",
    "It's reliable and still works after years of use.",
    "You can use it for PC games as well.",
    "\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb Addendum  I thought it was good that I could get a refund for the Amazon gift card since it was a return for a defective product within a month.",
    "Does this increase the calculation power?",
    "I think it's good for kids who understand math.",
    "Is it not possible for those who do not understand calculations to some extent?",
    "It's a hard problem.",
    "Also, when it comes to telling your parent to put the tools away, I've tried doing it myself but it never goes smoothly, no matter how many times I try.",
    "I guess it's easy to annoy people who are used to DS?",
    "I can't seem to get into drawing characters from comics, or even DS games, for that matter, because I feel like I'm not good at it, but I also feel like I can't get into it because I don't have the familiarity with it.",
    "The way it works is like a time trial, where you have to solve a certain number of questions in a certain amount of time.",
    "I understand that you are making them rush with tests...do you think they will become more focused and calculate better if they are stressed?",
    "I don't like the sound of the gong at the end either.",
    "I'm sure they're working hard, but couldn't they make it a bit more pleasant to hear?",
    "I feel like I'm losing money with this 6200 yen.",
    "I understand that this is half the price.",
    "Sorry, it's translated as \u26062",
    "Persona songs are good!",
    "Persona 3 gets to the ED.",
    "I played up to 5.",
    "Persona 4 is complete on Vita.",
    "What you can do is the same as in the previous Persona 4.",
    "The story is non-existent and feels shorter than the previous game.",
    "The music is really nice!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel good!",
    "Persona 3 characters were the first to be HD-ized, so I was moved when I first saw them.",
    "I guess Seon-hwa looks like a hunk (laugh) Persona 5 is beautiful from the start, so the freshness is not that great... If you think that way, then 3 is a better deal.",
    "As a game, I found 5 easier to play than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is blue based, so it was hard to see the backgrounds when they were dark.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see through the background.",
    "With the abundance of assist features, I think even those who are not good at games can enjoy playing.",
    "The challenge feature is a nice touch for those who are more experienced with the game.",
    "The triple pack comes with soundtracks, and not just a few tracks, but a solid 4 discs, so if you like the music in Persona, I recommend this.",
    "what?!",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the photo, but the actual one is a bit greenish and is closer to black or chocolate gray.",
    "And it wasn't a double buckle.",
    "I was thinking about buying a gold one, but I'm holding off for now, should I just give up on it because it's cheaper?",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller after the review was posted, saying that they would replace the item with a new one.",
    "The rest of the processing was quick.",
    "I think they were very good even though the product was cheap.",
    "Response: 4 stars  Follow-up: I also purchased the gold.",
    "The color is almost exactly like the photo and it's very pretty.",
    "But it is still not a double locking buckle, and the difference from the illustration is clear.",
    "That's a shame.",
    "It gets heavy in the evening.",
    "I used it on a SIM free iPhone 7s.",
    "At first, I didn\u2019t know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing my SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport (by going to settings > mobile communication > communication options and turning data roaming on), and it worked out fine.",
    "The instructions that came with the product didn't seem to matter much...?",
    "The thing is, I've been having a hard time getting 3G in the Gimpo airport area, which is notorious for bad reception.",
    "When I went out into the city, it became 4G.",
    "In the evening and night, the communication was sometimes very heavy, but I think I was reaching the maximum limit of how many MB I could use in a day.",
    "better than i expected.",
    "I had been using a SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, had it unlocked and was using it on Ymobile, but when the Z4 started to give up the ghost I was looking to buy a second hand Xperia, but then I found this phone which is a new one and I bought it.",
    "I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use it because I had been using Mobile Suica, but it worked just fine.",
    "Size, weight, silver, bought it, looks like an iPhone6?",
    "I don't play games so I don't know about the processing speed, but it seems a bit faster than the Z4.  I read a review that said the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it seems to take a bit of time to recognize it, so I use the face recognition.",
    "I thought it was like an iPhone and was amazing, but I also got an Android with Ver9 and I was satisfied with my purchase.",
    "Things that caught my attention  It would be better if it was smaller  There is no strap hole  * It is compatible with cases with strap hole  I have not tested its water resistance  It is a bit heavy  I have only used it a little bit but I am satisfied with it  I recommend it"
