    "I downloaded the bundled software but it didn't work so I downloaded ASIO first but I like the free piano sound so I use this for piano practice.",
    "I think I made a good purchase.",

    "40 minutes to complete the assembly.",
    "I'm done, let me check the product.",

    "The chair feels hard because it's a non-recycled high-density urethane foam, and it's not very comfortable to sit on (is the cushion too firm?",
    ") The mesh back part of the competition mesh is harder and thinner than other mesh chairs, so it hurts your back.",
    "It's a small thing, but the height from the seat to the ground is 530, not 550 (height is important for tall people), and the foot part that supports the caster is not made of steel, so there is a question about durability.",
    "I bought a new cushion and put a towel over the mesh part because it seems to wear out (get damaged) quickly.",
    "I'm 186cm and 80kg, and I feel that the only good thing about this product is the fit in the back, but I feel that the overall satisfaction is low, and I feel the same about other products that don't fit.",
    "I think it's best to try it out in person and sit in it before buying.",
    "I got a welcome email from the manufacturer, so I'm going to ask about the armrests and headrests?",
    "Under consideration.",

    "(Sometimes the picture freezes) I bought it and updated it right away and I\u2019m trying out the recording feature, but I wonder if the external 2.5 inch HDD is affecting it, because the picture freezes when playing and there is frame jumping.",
    "The user interface is not praised at all and is just \"can see 4K broadcasts\".",
    "By the way, when recording, I feel that it can only be replayed in the chase playback mode, so I also accept the additional function of being able to record in 4K on the HDD.",
    "It's easy to get caught up in the hype and buy into the hype, but excessive hype is a no-no.",

    "The enter key and backspace key no longer work.",
    "I would not recommend it at all, but if it's only 1000 yen, you might as well try it.",
    "If you have a good credit score, you should be able to use it for half a year.",
    "Other brands have the same price range but only offer 1 year to 3 years of warranty, while this one only offers 6 months.",
    "The short warranty period tells the story of how fragile it is.",
    "The product is the best, the packaging is the worst.",
    "I love this product, it's a different color than I expected but I love it.",
    "I highly recommend footstockers for those looking for them!!",
    "The only problem is that there is a big gap between the large roll and the box, and the delivery note was not included in the packaging, which was the worst.",
    "The lid was out of the box when I opened it.",
    "I would recommend this, but you might be better off buying it elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the strength, but I'll take it.",
    "I bought it because the support was no longer acceptable where I bought the cover.",

    "It looks like it will be comfortable for long trips.",

    "I have a TSA lock that I love and have a few others that I like because they are so convenient.",
    "And for a master of key forgetting and losing, I recommend Nabberlock.",

    "when you open it, it's huge...",
    "I tried them on and they were a little loose even with the insoles in.",

    "Wearing a lot of monochrome clothing makes you look brighter!",

    "At this price point, I would be satisfied with this build, but I think someone who bought the smaller size would be disappointed.",
    "I guess I leaked the gas...",
    "The Shilbako 25 leaked gas again, when I exchanged the valve there was a problem where part of the tank was missing, but when I used a vacuum pump to seal the tank and did a repair and upgrade, it became much easier to use, if you want to buy this Shilbako 25, you can disassemble it if you can take it apart, but I don't recommend it for people who don't have confidence in",
    "I thought it would be a pretty low quality for 188 yen",
    "You can use early returns and turks at your own discretion.",

    "It\u2019s just a matter of endurance.",

    "If you disconnect and reconnect the cable, you can operate it, but after a few minutes, the drone will move in a direction you can't control.",
    "I would not buy this.",
    "I'm warning you all.",

    "It might be easier for someone who is used to the DS.",
    "I can't help but like the illustrations in manga, and I think DS and such are fun because of the screen, but I don't know why I can't get attached to them.",
    "The method of calculation is also done in a way that competes with time, such as how many questions can be answered correctly in a certain amount of time.",
    "I understand that you want to rush the exams, but don't you think it's unfair to make them anxious and make them calculate?",

    "The characters in Persona 3 were HD for the first time, so I was moved when I first saw them.",

    "As a game, I felt it was more fun than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is mostly blue, but it was hard to see when the background was dark.",
    "The main colors are bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it's on a background.",

    "With the challenge function on, it becomes a game of teeth for a guitarist.",

    "that's too bad.",
    "I bought this keyboard because I liked the color in the picture, but the actual keyboard has a blue tint and is more of a charcoal gray than black.",
    "And it wasn't a double backflip.",
    "I was thinking of buying a gold too, but it's on hold for now. The price is so cheap, I might not be able to resist.",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller after the review was posted, asking me to return the item and exchange it for a new one.",
    "The rest of the processing was also done quickly.",

    "Four stars for the response.  Addendum: I also bought gold.",
    "The colors are almost exactly as in the picture and are very beautiful.",
    "But it's not a full back roll, and the difference is clear from the explanation picture.",
    "That's unfortunate.",
    "The evening is getting heavy.",
    "I used it on a SIM-free iPhone 7s.",
    "At first, I didn't know what to do after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM card, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Incheon Airport and she showed me (Settings > Mobile Communication > Communication Options, turn on Data Roaming).",
    "The lecture that came with the product didn't seem to have much to do with it...?",
    "However, around Kansai International Airport, the signal was poor, and I couldn't get 3G for a long time.",
    "When I went to the city, it became 4G.",
    "Sometimes the communication gets a little heavy in the evening or at night, and I think it might have reached a maximum of a few hundred MB per day.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I used SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim free and used it on Ymobile, but since Z4 was not doing well, I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that can be used with a SIM card for a new price, so I bought it.",
    "I used mobile Suica, I was worried it wouldn't work properly, but there were no problems at all.",
    "It looks like an iPhone 6 because of its size, weight, and silicone.",
    "I don't play games so the speed is the same as the Z4, just a little faster in my opinion.  The review said the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it just takes a little time to recognize, so I use face recognition instead.",
    "I thought it was amazing, just like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase, even though I upgraded to Android version 9.",
    "I noticed a few things that could be smaller  No strap hole *I can work around this if it has a strap hole  I haven't tested the waterproofness yet  It's a little heavy, but I haven't used it much and I'm satisfied with it  I recommend it"
