    "Its impact could be similar to the economic crisis in 2008.",

    "In many countries, the disease has already overwhelmed and nearly collapsed health services, and the restrictions imposed by governments have caused severe disruptions in the global economy.",
    "the impact of the pandemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be profound.",
    "Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.",
    "Traffickers may be unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods.",
    "Patterns of drug use and supply may change, and government responses may be hampered.",
    "The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but some lessons can be learned from past crises.",
    "After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to seek out cheaper synthetic substances and shifted to injecting drugs.",
    "At the same time, governments have been cutting drug-related budgets.",
    "Prevention interventions and drug treatment services could be hit hard if governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way.",
    "In addition, the priority of interdiction and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.",
    "Some countries have a significant amount of narcotics smuggled through commercial flights, and these countries are expected to be the most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.",
    "Messengers will carry methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs in their hand luggage or in their personal baggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air travel almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely disrupted.",
    "Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, activities involving the use of the dark web and parcel post for trafficking may increase.",
    "In the long term, economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.",
    "The rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities will make poor and vulnerable people more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, develop drug-related illnesses and turn to drug-related criminal activities, whether as producers or traffickers.",
    "Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of the situation to offer services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members.",
    "These shifts could quickly take root as governments' capacity to respond is reduced, becoming the new reality for many communities.",

    "The growth rate of drug use in developing countries has been much faster than that in developed countries over the past two decades.",
    "This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth during this period, 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.",
    "Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.",
    "During the period of 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.",
    "1Urbanization is a driving factor of the current and future drug markets.",
    "In both developed and developing countries, urban areas have higher drug use prevalence than rural areas.",
    "The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale migration of the population from rural to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.",
    "Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in developing countries where urbanization is more pronounced.",
    "Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the poorest people bear the greatest burden of disease, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.",
    "Cocaine and other drugs are also more strongly associated with the world 's wealthier regions.",
    "Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug abuse is higher among the socially affluent.",
    "However, the rate of transition to drug dependence is higher among those with lower socioeconomic status.",
    "data from a few countries suggest that the association between harmful patterns of drug use and disease is concentrated among the poor.",
    "These patterns are less common in wealthier societies.",
    "The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labour market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to increased drug use in the past, and the pandemic has already forced hundreds of millions of people into unemployment.",
    "The pandemic could lead to further expansion of drug markets. The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of reduced state control or because of the economic crisis, which may lead more people to resort to illicit activities.",

    "There are around 500 new psychoactive substances on the domestic market in member states every year.",
    "Currently, the majority of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoids and small amounts of synthetic opioids.",
    "While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion of those substances has changed.",
    "In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, the new psychoactive substances of the opioid type accounted for only 2 per cent, but this figure had risen to 9 per cent by 2018.",
    "Many of the new psychoactive substances in the opioid class are fentanyl analogues, whose effects and dangers have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America and elsewhere, but to a lesser extent.",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and is also used to make counterfeit prescription opioids.",
    "There is some evidence of injection of new psychoactive substances stimulants in Europe as well: a study of residues in discarded syringes in six European cities found that many syringes contained new psychoactive substances that produced stimulant effects.",
    "2 the use of new psychoactive substances may be firmly established among vulnerable groups.",
    "Single types of new psychoactive substances have almost never formed a large market.",
    "evidence from Europe, however, suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prisoners.",

    "Policy changes and trends",
    "Most jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis for nonmedical use have seen an increase in its use.",
    "Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the US allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.",
    "In the two states that first passed legislation in the US, Colorado and Washington, adult use of marijuana has increased, particularly in the past month and on a daily or near daily basis, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that cannabis use has increased in Uruguay since 2011 , with almost a doubling of use in the past month .",
    "This suggests that the increase is largely driven by frequent and regular use of marijuana.",
    "Short-term data from Canada also indicate that increases in use have been accompanied by an expansion of the legal market from 2018 to 2019.",
    "However, in 2019, 40 percent of cannabis users still obtained some products from illicit sources.",
    "Is the reason for the global drop in seizures of cannabis herb legalization?",
    "In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years, driven by a decline in North America, which has seen a 84% drop in the past decade.",
    "In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world almost doubled over the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.",
    "The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but the effect of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances is still difficult to assess.",
    "Countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence of use of these substances.",

    "Vulnerable populations face harms from both the licit and illicit drug markets. Pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high @-@ income countries.",
    "In 2018, more than 90% of all medically consumable opioids were in high-income countries.",
    "approximately 50 % in North America , 40 % in Europe , and 2 % in Oceania .",
    "these countries account for approximately 12 % of the global population .",
    "The population of low- and middle-income countries is estimated to account for 88% of the global population, but less than 10% of the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids.",
    "Obstacles to access to pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation , culture , health systems , and prescribing practices .",
    "Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug-related illnesses. About 35.6 million people had drug-related illnesses in 2018.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization can increase the risk of and exacerbate the consequences of drug use. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where the social and economic trajectory of individuals is not only their status at a given point in time but also related to the risk of drug use.",
    "Drug use also deepens socioeconomic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby perpetuating the cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be linked to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexual and gender diverse groups, those displaced by conflict or disaster, and those living in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by the disease or face problems accessing treatment.",
    "According to the disability adjusted life years ( DALY ) indicator , which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death , the harmful effects of drug use have increased over the past decade.",
    "Global disability adjusted life years due to drug use increased by 17 % between 2007 and 2018 .",

    "the relationship between drugs and violence is complex , and it is difficult to determine all the causal links between the use of psychoactive substances and violence .",
    "Limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.",
    "However , in violent events , alcohol seems to play a larger role than drugs .",
    "While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this link can be partly attributed to multiple mediators, such as socioeconomic disadvantage, and other types of adversity caused by individual risk factors, family environment, and peers.",
    "The link between drug dealing and violence is multifaceted.",
    "where there is a stable criminal structure , large scale organized criminal activity , including international drug trafficking , can be carried out without violence .",
    "In the short term, the existence and extent of violence is more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.",
    "the latest trends",
    "Cannabis is the most commonly used substance, with opioids causing the most harm",
    "an estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug globally.",
    "By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "But the related harms of opioids are often overlooked because they are less common.",
    "Of the estimated 167,000 drug use disorder deaths in 2017, 66 percent were caused by these substances, and 50 percent of the estimated 2.1 million years of life lost due to drug use disorders or premature deaths were caused by these substances.",
    "Nonmedical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the crisis is driven by tramadol; in North America, it is fentanyl. The two regions have almost nothing in common in terms of economic, demographic, or drug use patterns, but they are both struggling with an opioid crisis fueled by the availability and low cost of materials to produce them.",
    "In North America, the use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to a surge in opioid overdose deaths over the past two decades.",
    "In 2018, two thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths recorded in the United States involved fentanyl.",
    "Canada also reported similar findings, but at lower numbers.",
    "Part of the reason fentanyl is causing overdose deaths is that it is unpredictable in the illicit drug market.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for nonmedical use of tramadol has grown substantially.",
    "In the region, there has been a growing use of tramadol for the treatment of the condition.",
    "In 2017, global seizures of tramadol increased significantly, peaking at more than 12,500 tons.",
    "However, in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.",
    "The crisis in both places was fueled by the ease of manufacture and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl-like substances or their precursors.",
    "What exacerbates the crisis in both regions is that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making it harder to detect and prevent their abuse.",
    "Stimulant use continues to rise",
    "The cocaine and methamphetamine markets are the most significant in the world of stimulants, and both substances are seeing increased use in their primary markets.",
    "About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as it is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "Some 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used ATS in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for two decades.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes substitute for each other, with the use of one drug rising as the use of the other falls, and sometimes both increasing and decreasing to meet the same market demand.",
    "COVID-19 increases risk for injecting drug users",
    "An estimated 11.3 million people inject drugs, and around 10% of global HIV infections are attributed to injecting drug use.",
    "More than 1 million people who inject drugs are living with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, there were around 585,000 drug-related deaths, half of which were caused by liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which is still largely untreated among injecting drug users.",
    "5 The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute with more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.",
    "As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, more harmful use patterns may emerge.",

    "The EU's move is reportedly a response to the growing problem of illegal immigration in Europe. Now, the EU's core problem is that the number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be repatriated is very small.",
    "According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to \"immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds\" to strengthen external borders with infrastructure and surveillance.",
    "However, the EU and its member states have been at odds over issues such as the cost of the fence.",
    "Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not pay for the costs.",

    "Whether it is to lure South Korea to establish a \"technology alliance\" or to establish a \"quadrilateral alliance\" of chips with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a \"semiconductor industrial chain\" through the mechanism of the \"Quad\" and the \"Indo-Pacific Economic Framework\" by the United States, the United States, through the means of politicizing, camping, and weaponizing, intends",

    "The Dutch ASML, a global leader in lithography, recently warned that the ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.",
    "According to American media, many American companies have suffered from the brutal suppression of the US government on the chip and semiconductor industries in China, including developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of semiconductor equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.",
    "The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.",
    "The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has already formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.",

    "From a structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still present, but the proportion is relatively low; the new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare has increased significantly, and the data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry still exists.",
    "Combining the rebound of service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor shortage data, which also exceeded expectations, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has experienced rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.",
    "We believe that the tight supply and demand of the US labor market will be difficult to improve without a recession.",
    "At present, the US labor market still has a supply gap of more than 5 million, and the labor participation rate is slow to rise, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds has already approached the pre-epidemic high point.",
    "In addition, the strong consumption demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the labor market due to the strong savings and consumer credit of US residents.",
    "The continued tightness of the US labor market will be the backdrop of the US economy in 2023.",
    "We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth, given the current near-end of interest rate hikes, the continuous repetition of inflation expectations, and the end of the pandemic.",
    "Prior to the release of this data, the US stock and bond market was overly optimistic about the Fed\u2019s interest rate hike path.",
    "As inflation data continued to improve, the Fed maintained a balance between shortening the pace of interest rate hikes and keeping the market's inflation expectations fragile, but the market ignored the Fed's hawkish statements and expected not only to stop raising interest rates earlier, but also to cut interest rates twice at the end of the year.",
    "In the context of tight labor market supply and demand and the unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed\u2019s guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the extreme adjustment and crowded trading expectations of the market may cause some harm to the market.",
    "However, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change in the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI leading indicators, the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a base for future inflation data, and the current market expectation is difficult to prove, and the market",

    "Many online analyses and speculations suggest that it could be another Chinese balloon.",
    "It may be from China, like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, performing some kind of mission.",
    "Some have linked the Alaska \"object\" to \"unidentified flying objects\" (UFOs).",
    "\"I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO,\" former U.S. Congressman Peter Meijer tweeted on Friday, according to Newsweek.",
    "\"The irony of lumping alien spacecraft in with weather balloons is surprising, but not worth triggering an interstellar conflict,\" Meijer said.",
    "Meijer tweeted shortly after Kobe confirmed the object in Alaska had been shot down.",
    "Newsweek said that Meijer is not the only one who suspects the object was a UFO.",

    "Amazon's customer service attitude is hard to believe",
    "I'm guessing very few people will see this, but I'll say it anyway.",
    "The shirt we bought was a lace-up collar shirt, and the one that ended up being sent to me was a short sleeve.",
    "I immediately contacted Amazon customer service after receiving the shirt, and was assured that it was still in stock, and I requested a refund, and they said they would take care of it, and then immediately saw that the product name had changed to short sleeve, and I had bought a link that had been removed.",
    "Then the customer service informed me to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.",
    "Is this how Amazon handles these situations?",
    "It\u2019s really hard to believe, the mistake of the clothes itself is not my problem, as a consumer I asked for the goods I should get, I didn\u2019t make any exaggerated request, but Amazon changed the name to say no stock.",
    "This is my first long review, I hope it is not my last.",
    "The incomprehensible sleeves",
    "It is indeed hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks, and you can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s real leather. Also, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the skirt, but usually only by 1-2 cm. This dress is 5 cm longer, and the sleeves should naturally hang down at the wrist, but the",
    "It's easy to buy clothes, it's easy to return them.",
    "But when will the money be refunded?",
    "The workmanship of the dress is good, but because the size is too small, I have to return it, but after returning the goods, it has been more than a week, and I haven\u2019t received the refund yet?",
    "And the buyer has to contact the dishonest Fullpeak Express themselves, this is the worst shopping experience since I bought Amazon products!",
    "But the store is still good, and they actively cooperate with the courier to refund the money in a timely manner. However, the work of this Fullfast Courier is really angry. It took about half a month to refund the money. This partner is to drag Amazon's legs. The efficiency is poor, and there is no sense of service!",
    "What cities are the best for a child that young?",
    "99 seconds to kill.",
    "The workmanship, color, and feel of the sweatpants are all good, they are soft/thin/thick enough, and they don\u2019t smell like coal oil.",
    "Unfortunately, the model is slim, which is more suitable for young people.",
    "3XL, flat waist 2.5 feet, stretch max size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg waist is a little tight.",
    "There seems to be no elastic waistband, and it is quite difficult to loosen the waist.",
    "Also, it is not comfortable to wear it tightly.",
    "Good, not very bright",
    "The price has increased by more than 200 yuan since I bought it. What is going on?",
    "This is the first time I have used Amazon\u2019s cooperative partner, DHL, and the first time the delivery person did not come to my house. Later, the delivery person called me twice to arrange the delivery time, but the delivery person did not come. Later, I directly returned the goods, and this delivery person has no integrity. I strongly recommend not to use DHL again.",
    "This time, they also returned a polo shirt I ordered, and the price has increased by more than 100 yuan.",
    "Amazon should not have this kind of product",
    "I bought it when it was on sale, and it is not cheap, but the reviews are also very good.",
    "I was stunned when I received the product, with large areas of wear on the surface of the product, and wear in many other places, it was either a substandard product or a used product, see the picture below.",
    "I applied for a return, and the manufacturer's person said that it was caused by transportation after seeing the picture, is that nonsense?",
    "How could the inside of the product be worn?",
    "There are only two possibilities: either it is a substandard or a used product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.",
    "Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's self-owned goods, customers choose Amazon is trust, customer win, we win, customer's victory is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone will work together to improve, thank you.",

    "I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two sets of E2 on the right side of the receiver often appear red, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, and this is not consistent with the transmitter module that can work for 7 years on the Amazon website, and I can\u2019t find after-sales service on the Amazon website, so I don\u2019t know how to do",

    "The label on the box was torn off and the label on the body was broken.",
    "And it always goes blank.",
    "It was fine after I changed it.",
    "The exchange was fast, it was a bit blurry at night, the viewing angle was not very wide, but it was enough for ordinary home use.",
    "The only drawback is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and the other is that I have bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.",
    "There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, but there is no sticker this time, and there is a sticker similar to the one you can stick on the warranty card when you buy the phone, but there is no sticker this time.",
    "I don't know if it's cheaper so there's no more, it's very confusing.",
    "waiting for the supplier to respond",
    "There is no label on the package, so I called the supplier and said that the lack of label is genuine. If you suspect it, you can use the corner of the package to mail it to Johnson & Johnson for verification, and leave your license plate number and phone number, and promise to send a text message to enter my information into the warranty card on the Johnson & Johnson website, but I haven\u2019t received the text message yet?",

    "I support Star Crown, support Sheng Pai, and effectively protect the car.",
    "Japanese Amazon caused serious damage to the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8c's caterpillar was shipped as 8cm's caterpillar) (8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c)",
    "They admitted their mistake, but they kept pushing the blame, and they always emphasized that the goods were third party, and they could not bind the third party.",
    "Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.",
    "I originally bought the page size option of 7c, 8, 9c, and I thought it was a trap, so I called the Chinese Amazon customer service and clearly told them that 8 was 8c, but when the goods arrived in China, I found that there was only 8cm, and I felt that it was completely a trap deliberately set up to cheat Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), and now the page",
    "Chinese customer service: I'm sorry, we caused you losses, we give you two options:",
    "1, you return the item and the buyer pays for all shipping fees.",
    "2, you don't return the goods, we compensate you 1000 yen.",

    "I chose option 2, I have shoes, and finally they compensated me with 2000 yen, and the final loss was 150rmb. Customer service: We have recorded it, we will handle it seriously, and the next day they returned the mail, saying that I did not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and that was it.",
    "I asked: when the purchase page has such confusing options as 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me to say that the Japanese code is not like this, it is similar to 140, but do you go to other bug pages?",
    "There are codes for both, and there are codes that are mixed.",
    "Secondly, why did you put 8cm in the middle between 7c and 9c, which is the smallest size, what does it mean to put it there.",
    "Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know if you want to return to your country, so we won't compensate for your shipping fee.",
    "I don\u2019t understand this logic, I am Japanese, I need Chinese customer service, Chinese people living in Japan don\u2019t need Chinese customer service, tourists in Japan don\u2019t have the ability to call international long distance, so the question is, who needs to call Amazon international customer service in Chinese, except for people like me who shop on Amazon Japan.",
    "Isn't the Chinese customer service of Amazon just for the convenience of these people who shop online?",
    "I am not satisfied with this purchase",
    "This is the second time I bought Pampers from Amazon, I bought a box when my baby was 2 months old, and I chose the European imported paper diapers, and the first time I bought it was pretty satisfied, my baby used one diaper all night, and it was really good for 12 hours without changing.",
    "But this time I bought L-size diapers, and there were two packs in one box. When I opened it, I felt that the paper was a bit soft, and it was obviously different from the imported Pampers. After using it for my baby, it was still okay, and there were no signs of leaks or rashes.",
    "However, when the second pack of diapers was opened, the inner thigh of the baby's leg immediately developed a rash, which has not faded away to this day.",
    "I doubt the quality of the two packs in one box.",
    "I will not buy it again in the future!",
    "I hope that the transportation protection of the package will be taken seriously.",
    "This is the worst packaging and delivery I have ever seen after online shopping. There is absolutely no protection, cushioning foam, buffering layer material, etc.",
    "It's a deformed box.",
    "And the soft plastic box inside was packed in a cardboard box, which was crushed and deformed.",
    "I hope it is genuine, and the quality is guaranteed, I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.",
    "I prefer to buy domestic products that are half the price but have a guarantee.",
    "And the problem of the packaging of the goods, I read the comments in 2016, and now in 2019, it is still the same.",
    "It explains that Amazon does not care about the feedback of services at all, and it is too far away from JD and Tmall in China.",
    "It looks good, but there are a few regrets",
    "The whole cup is the color I like, orange red, although my husband is the boss in our family, but I still think that orange red and yellow are eye-catching.",
    "It's smaller than I imagined, but since it's meant to be taken out of the house, it's still acceptable.",
    "I took it home last night and tried it out. After the bottle cap is pushed open, the distance between the straw and the cap is too close. Because the straw is in a vertical position, my son always has to hold the bump on the cap with his mouth while drinking, so I wonder if this part can be improved.",
    "It seems that the straw cup of other brands is reasonable to make the straw inclined. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.",
    "Lightweight and large capacity",
    "I like it lightweight, and the opening is large, but the two independent separators are a bit redundant for me, and I don't know what to put in.",
    "After buying, I found that there was another brand that was very similar to Meadow in the overseas purchase of Meiya, which was less than two hundred yuan.",
    "Fake, it's particularly impressive",
    "Amazon sells fake goods, and I have fallen for it too.",
    "The customer service said that because it was used, it could not be returned, and I didn\u2019t use it, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fake.",
    "Because of trust, it is heartbreaking, after all, it is a facial cleansing product, so please buy it from a physical store, and pay a little more.",
    "Because it was a flash sale, I didn\u2019t read the reviews, and I have already reported the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let\u2019s fight for our rights together.",
    "bad?",
    "Fake?",
    "In short, it is a tragedy.",
    "The second one was fine, but when I opened it, it smelled terrible, so I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before, and when I put it on my face, I couldn\u2019t stand it at all, it was so strong, I couldn\u2019t describe it, I started coughing immediately, my eyes were also hurting, and I was crying, so I took it off and washed my face.",
    "I didn't believe in the evil and opened another piece of the same brand, which didn't have such a strong smell, and I am currently applying it.",
    "I remember it smells like bad hair spray in a salon.",
    "I can\u2019t imagine that Amazon\u2019s own skincare products will be avoided from now on.",
    "Oh, the traitorous businesses!",
    "At the time of purchase, the promotional page said that the gift of \u201cthree-body complete set\u201d was given for more than 99 yuan, but the gift was not included in the package, and I called the customer service to ask them to show me the screenshot of the promotion at that time, the problem is that whoever buys things still saves the webpage screenshot, you have done the promotion yourself, you still need the customer to provide you with it, so please",
    "After using it, I felt",
    "I bought things from Amazon for the first time, and I felt several things. First, let me talk about the feeling of using the product. The first thing is that it is indeed painless and has no stimulating taste. Overall, it is not bad. It will fall off after waiting for about 8 minutes, and there will be a small amount of sweat dirt on it, but it is not obvious to the naked eye, so overall it is not bad. As",
    "Anyway, I guess this stuff is really good.",
    "Second, from the 27th order, the goods were received on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is half a month, and the delivery service attitude of Amazon is also very good.",
    "Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday, order on Friday, and wait for 2 days, it will be cheaper, almost 12 yuan, that is, I bought more than 170 (plus shipping fee), it feels like they are raising the price for the event.",
    "The customer service said that the price fluctuation, I have been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price is just like this, and the fluctuation is not big.",
    "Affordable price, made in Japan, with Chinese label, with grains, absolutely buy back!",
    "It has a grain in the paste, which is just right for a refreshing feeling, and the paste is smooth after brushing, which is much better than some second-hand products. They say that it is an imported product, but many products do not have Chinese labels, so I don\u2019t know where they are wholesaled.",
    "In the future, I will never buy second-hand goods again as long as Amazon has them.",
    "I have a suggestion, the Amazon app sometimes can't show the order, I hope they can improve the application, it will be better and better!",
    "These years, JD has been getting worse and worse, and there is no service quality to speak of!",
    "The garbage is excellent and does not care about customer needs. When placing an order, the delivery time is particularly 19:00-22:00.",
    "Because there is an elderly person in the family who is not comfortable with the bed after surgery, so only in the evening can it be convenient to receive the package.",
    "And the result was delivered at 12 noon, without any prior notice.",
    "If the delivery time is at the discretion of your courier, why do you need to make a time for the customer to choose?",
    "If your logistics can\u2019t guarantee the service, then you\u2019d better not be an e-commerce company!",
    "A 90-year-old man with three wounds on his body had to get out of bed, open the door, and pay for the delivery!",
    "The order has a contact phone number!",
    "No one called to explain!",
    "The so-called complaint customer service of JD.com is a group of outsiders who pretend to be there, make up excuses for your complaint, and then give you a so-called response.",
    "There will be no changes or compensation!",
    "I had encountered this kind of problem before, and I had tolerated it, but this time I couldn't tolerate it, it was too much!",
    "The new book I bought was pre-sale and arrived, but the front and back cover were reversed. It was obvious that the quality was a problem, so I closed my eyes and sent the book to the customer?",
    "No one will contact you about the negative feedback.",
    "Over the years, Excellent has become worse and worse, and there is no service quality to speak of!",
    "I will never spend another penny on Excellence.",
    "The quality of the pictures is really unacceptable.",
    "As a title of \u201cAncient Atlas\u201d, the book is really hard to accept in terms of the choice of pictures, layout, and printing, and some pictures are even mosaic, blurred to the point of unrecognizable.",
    "Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small picture, it should be worthy of the ancient Chinese literature data left by our ancestors in the catalog!",
    "(And many of the pictures can be obtained from the relevant industry resources in clear original files), what is the difference between the book with these pictures and without pictures?",
    "!I am sorry for this kind of learning spirit.",
    "The text is not evaluated, and the family names are not distinguishable.",
    "Overall 2 stars.",
    "I read this book in high school, and I only read it because I was bored. I thought that I wouldn\u2019t get addicted to this kind of book, because I wasn\u2019t really interested in the web novels that I had read before.",
    "Then... I fell into the pit.",
    "According to this plot, the whole book is relatively light and enjoyable. When Ye Shu was still in the game, even if the guilds were fighting against each other, they were not heavy because they were often bloodied by Ye Shu.",
    "As for the competition part, it wrote out the bitterness of the change of the times and the alternation of the old and new (probably because I am too sentimental).",
    "The whole book took me a lot of time to read in high school, but I couldn't stop.",
    "The full-time description of characters and relationships is amazing, and some characters are only passed by occasionally, but they will leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters who are described in detail, such as Ye Shu, Huang Shaotian, and Song Meng, have a large number of fans, and the characters who are not in the center of the writing, such as Jiang Bo, Chu Yunxiu, etc., are also very popular",
    "And in terms of romance, there is no common problem of three thousand concubines or beautiful women or corrupt women in the web novels that plague the readers, all the characters in the novel have one thing in common, they like the game Glory, and they all want to win in a fair way.",
    "There are small plots, but no big conspiracies, and everyone seems so innocent and cute.",
    "This may also be why there are no dislikable characters in the novel.",
    "The author's IP is very large, and this is also due to this.",
    "Apart from the phenomenon of online literature, Qian Zhong is not a bad book.",
    "He really does provide some blood and a little bit of emotion.",
    "This April, all-star will be animated.",
    "I actually wanted to buy this book for a long time, but I never had enough money to buy it, and then when I wanted to buy it, I found that the TB was full of fake products, but I found out that there was another version of the book recently, and I really like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought a set at once.",
    "Next, I will briefly describe the situation of the goods.",

    "\u25cfOverall, it is satisfactory, 24 books are in a large box, which is very satisfying.",
    "The little lion was sad.",
    "When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as Lost in Translation, but there was still a lot of text!",
    "I read it three times before I let my little friend read it, a lion that can shoot and loves jelly beans.",
    "When I saw the scene of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable, and modern urban people are not very accepting of such arrangements for being eaten by animals.",
    "When he finally sees the little lion, who has lost himself, he is neither completely lion nor completely human.",
    "Finally, only the back of the little lion is left, and we don\u2019t know where he went.",
    "Maybe years later, the image of the little lion will still be in the memory of the grown-up child, and will be recalled by chance one day, perhaps touching or inspiring her.",
    "A collection of works with high value",
    "1. I didn\u2019t know TASCHEN before, but I bought a lot of their books recently because they are so powerful, whether it is the topic or the production itself.",
    "This work has been published in three versions, the largest of which is almost 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, like the Michelangelo Complete Works; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and it comes in a two-volume set with a book box.",
    "I personally think it is still acceptable, firstly because it is cheap and has over 700 pages divided into two volumes, making it easier to read as a softcover; secondly, unlike the Michelangelo Complete Works, this one is different in that the paintings are the main focus, and the black and white manuscripts by Da Vinci take up the majority, making this version the best value for budget-conscious readers who are not art professionals.",
    "2. The explanations of the paintings are great, with analysis of the composition, sketches, and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a printing or book size problem, some of the shadow parts are too deep, and I can't see the details, which is a bit regrettable.",
    "3. Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.",
    "The former is already a genius, and the latter is so broad and high that it cannot be described as a genius.",
    "If you only look at the paintings, you can only feel half of Da Vinci, and after reading the manuscript, you have no words.",
    "Garbage, whoever buys it will regret it!",
    "I never give a bad review, this is a real garbage, I bought it and wasted money, give me a reason!",
    "1. The time is not right, and suddenly it becomes January 1st, and time is reset.",
    "2. The poor quality belt is not silicone, and it causes allergies and bubbles on the wrist.",

    "Sadness total Happiness total Anger total Emotional regulation total",
    "I was worried about the packaging of the camera at first, but luckily this time it came with an inflatable bag, and the camera was consistent with the three-digit code, and I could also register it on the official website, and the shutter count was 0, so I could only wait for the time to check it.",
    "The delivery speed is still pretty fast, here I complain about the courier, precious items are placed in the door room, he walked away so fast that I couldn\u2019t open the box to check it, this is really speechless.",
    "The seller thought about the customer before shipping:)",
    "The seller is responsible, and he called to ask about the screen size of the camera, which is really thoughtful.",
    "The delivery speed is also fast.",
    "The gold film is also suitable and useful.",
    "The battery is not fully charged.",
    "The machine is really good, I wonder how it is that the first time I charged it, it didn't charge fully, and the charging indicator light was always red",
    "Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so you can only give feedback in the product reviews.",
    "1. On March 29, I purchased this book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it was shown that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, at which time the Amazon website could not preview the book (because it had not yet been released);",
    "2. On March 31, the book was pushed to the device, and the content was blank, only saying please wait, and the electronic version of the book was reduced to 18 yuan on Amazon;",
    "3. I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and synchronize it again, but I can't get the electronic version of \"The Nature of Business\" with the actual content, but I can preview the book on Amazon's official website.",
    "I have a few thoughts at the moment",
    "1. The price issue is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank book on kindle with a book with real content, rather than always downloading \"please wait\"",
    "The books that were pre-ordered should not be bought again, because if you jump the queue, it is very complicated to download another book with empty content.",
    "3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel to feedback such problems. When downloading e-books or using them, there should be a place to feedback (work order, online customer service can be used, and you can refer to how Microsoft official store does it).",
    "I don't recommend reading it.",
    "I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see it in my memory and write down my feelings.",
    "This book is not a collection of short stories, but rather a collection of fragments of life about love.",
    "The tone of the book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the words and phrases are extremely simple, and the plot is as quiet and plain as the streets in the afternoon of summer.",
    "Each short story is a snapshot of a small part of ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.",
    "Finally, they are collected together under the title of \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".",
    "I think this collection of short stories, and its title, is a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not only the ups and downs of the stage, the myths of the sea and the rocks, or the sticky and glue-like relationship between you and me. Love is not only what is above, and should not be represented by what is above. Love is also the plain and boring life, the dull and tasteless day after",
    "When you read this book, you may recall the quarrels of your husband and wife, the tasteless marriage of people you know, and the unsatisfactory love.",
    "This is the reason why I do not recommend reading this book. From the aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, unless your life is turbulent or sweet like living in a candy castle, otherwise you will feel strange and boring when reading.",
    "And in terms of depth of thought, the everyday scenarios are not particularly illuminating or expansive (unlike Marquez\u2019s Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief snippets do not address any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to failed relationships.",
    "What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?",
    "So I would not recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not is not that significant.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and style than through the story, which is also the reason why the reading experience of this book is not good.",
    "It is suitable for a quick read, not for a detailed reading.",
    "The book is well-structured, but not very full.",
    "It explains what and why of many sales theories, but is weak in how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not giving specific practices.",
    "Also, the book feels like it was put together.",
    "For example, there are both domestic and foreign; both famous entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.",
    "It is not clear whether these stories are compiled for the sake of examples, and if the author has experienced some of these stories, it would be more convincing.",
    "The customer is referred to as a client or customer.",
    "The title is still customer, but in the main text, it has become customer.",
    "The e-book also had problems with misspellings, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering.",
    "In summary, this book is a good choice as an introduction to the theory, but it is not suitable for people who have already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales level.",
    "A Quick Guide to Internet Finance",
    "This book is shallow, and can be said to be only an introduction, which can help you quickly understand the overall situation of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still need to follow the map and dig it yourself.",
    "And the book was written earlier, so the content of later Alipay WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned, and now the proportion of third-party payment is probably not as small as the book said.",
    "Nowadays, many people take their mobile phones with them when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank flow.",
    "However, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introduction book, which shows that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the financial development history at home and abroad, so it can write such popular and easy-to-understand content.",
    "It is easy to write high and wide, but it is difficult to write in plain language.",
    "I appreciate you, and I want you to know that!",
    "The first factor that determines a person\u2019s job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether they are given enough attention and recognition in their work.",
    "According to Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy, after the basic needs of human survival are met, the most urgent need is the psychological need of being understood, recognized and appreciated.",
    "Indeed, for the Chinese people, most of them are \u201chard to say \u2018I love you\u2019\u201d, even if they have love, gratitude and praise, they will keep it in their hearts and not say it out loud.",
    "In this book, the author explains five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, physical touch, and receiving gifts.",
    "I think the important thing is not to know what the five languages of appreciation are, but to be able to use them from the bottom of your heart to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.",
    "In fact, the more intimate the person, the more they need praise and gratitude, and this is how we can make our lives more beautiful.",
    "Learning to praise can also help companies retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the rate of resignation.",
    "Thank you to the translator for bringing us the wonderful foreign thoughts and the world.",
    "Due to the differences in the cultural background between the East and the West, there will be some differences between the languages, and if you have the opportunity to read the original version, I believe you will gain more.",
    "Thank you again to the author and translator, as well as the editors, for their hard work!",
    "Amazon, please strictly check the products suspected of being counterfeit",
    "The quality is terrible, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and it is even worse than the products on the roadside stall, there is no weight, no code, and the packaging of ten bags is also loose, and it is completely not a qualified product; it is Amazon's worst shopping experience, and I have applied for a refund; it is completely a quality problem; I recommend that the seller wipe his eyes and refuse to accept",
    "We hope that Amazon can be strict with the source of goods.",
    "The product is not as good as I expected.",
    "Another benefit: No benefits!",
    "1. Big brand, cheap price.",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but there is a gap with my expectation.",
    "weaknesses:",
    "1. No indicator light for charging, this is the most basic, you have saved on your power indicator, and I estimate that customers who buy products for 300 yuan, in the eyes of Panasonic, are also a waste, without respect.",
    "2. Strong odor. When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of burning plastic.",
    "I tried it in the office for a day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.",
    "Compared with the same priced Philips PHILIPS I used before, although it has more blades, the quality of this Panasonic product is really not worthy of consumers.",
    "Foodstuff vacuum packaging machine",
    "I received the express delivery and saw that it was written as the e-commerce version, so I knew that I had been cheated again. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket, and it should be M. It was not the same as the picture packaging on the product introduction, so it was the new version.",
    "Three stars are blamed on my carelessness for not looking at the product specifications, and I have no objections to the M code version you sell, but what do you mean by \u201cnot the right version\u201d?",
    "The online store is a scam, so I\u2019ll just go to the supermarket instead.",
    "It's just soy sauce.",
    "I don't like the taste",
    "The kid doesn't like the taste of toothpaste, and every time he says it's spicy, maybe there's a more appropriate word to describe it, but for now, that's the only word he has in his vocabulary.",
    "I bought it when I was doing the activity, so I was embarrassed to give it a bad review, so I\u2019ll give it four stars, but I won\u2019t buy it again.",
    "Original, packaging is good.",
    "The packaging is complete, and there is an inflatable bag inside. There is only one product that looks like a bald head without online reviews.",
    "The plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle is the same as described in the picture, and the delivery is also fast, and it arrived the next day.",
    "It is genuine, but it is out of stock, and I don't know when it will be back in stock.",
    "A bad shopping experience",
    "I ordered on the 5th of November, but the package never arrived. After checking, I found out that the package had been signed for, but none of my colleagues had signed for it. I contacted the courier company, but they said that they could only initiate an investigation after the package had been sent. I contacted Amazon customer service, and I had to wait more than 10 days before I finally found out that the package had been delivered to the wrong address",
    "Wrong picture",
    "I thought I could receive the headphones in picture 1, but I received the headphones in picture 2 instead. The inconsistency of the picture is okay, but what does it mean that the left and right headphones have different volume?",
    "Although the name is the same, I hope everyone can pay attention and ask Amazon to replace the correct picture in a timely manner, thank you very much.",
    "The operating system is generally",
    "After a while, the overall picture is still good, and there is no difference, but this system makes people feel tangled, the boot time is obviously a little slow, and it is impossible to make good settings, and the software that comes with it is not worth commenting on, and the response speed is even worse, which is not a number compared to my colleague's.",
    "I read the reviews that said the design was very human-friendly, but I couldn't find where it was human-friendly, and the location of the remote control, which is often used, the up, down, left, and right buttons, and the back button, is really not up to par.",
    "So, let's just use it as a TV, and add a TV box or something.",
    "The price cut is too awesome.",
    "The price drop is too awesome, from more than 100 to 99 now!",
    "I have a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied sentence as the content of the rating.",
    "If I use this sentence to evaluate, I will say that this product is at least 85 points.",
    "I would never be lazy to copy and paste the reviews for the bad products, because other consumers will use this as a reference when buying and the seller will improve the quality of the product.",
    "Low price is good, no fever is enough!",
    "This is a cheap line, but it should meet the HDMI certification standard. Compared with the dog stuff in Akihabara (the price is twice as much), the line is thick and soft. The 7-meter transmission is without noise, and I will trust the low-priced line in the future!",
    "The product is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really bad compared to other websites.",
    "After placing the order, I found that I had made a mistake, but I could not cancel the order, and the webpage showed an error link and could not contact the online customer service.",
    "After the goods arrived, the delivery man called me and I said I didn't want it, but I couldn't cancel the order, so the delivery man took it back and said to sign for it first, and then I could apply for a refund.",
    "When I applied for a refund, I was told that once the food was signed for, it could not be returned, and I could not call Amazon customer service, who also said the same thing, that once the food was signed for, it could not be returned.",
    "I have bought non-refundable items before on JD and Suning, including milk and underwear, and contacted customer service to get a refund, and the same thing happened with the underwear I bought on JD, which smelled too much when I opened it, so I contacted customer service and they gave me a refund, but not on Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, people are alive, how do you deal with your customer service?",
    "Tell me whether I can pick it up myself or let the delivery person buy it, it is not easy for the delivery person to buy it, why do I have to let the delivery person pay for something that I did not buy?",
    "Okay, I didn't return it either, I took it myself, but I have to give your service a 1",
    "Please, don't waste your money",
    "First, I was looking forward to buying, and I thought that the Dali brand should not be bad, but when I received it, I thought that the packaging was still good, the size was not bad, but there was one box that was basically soft, and it was not visible from the outside, so you need to feel it, and when you eat it, there is no taste at all, it is tasteless, and when you bite it, the fruit is",
    "I will never buy fruit from an e-commerce platform again!",
    "Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark",
    "The corner of the bottle is depressed, which is probably caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is heartbreaking, after all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is still an international purchase, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeit mark, and the bottle is very easy to open, the key is that the layer of honey inside is directly blown out, there is almost no adhesive",
    "As someone born in China, I don't understand it.",
    "It should be genuine, right?",
    "And it also said that it would arrive in 20 days, but it arrived in 14 days. This is my first time buying overseas here, so I just wrote down my doubts, maybe it's all normal?",
    "The delivery service needs to improve",
    "I bought 5 vouchers in total, and when I made my first reservation, I was only sent 2 of the 3 vouchers I ordered, and after much communication, I was assured that they had been lost and that I would be sent the missing vouchers; for my second reservation, I was lucky enough to be able to make it on a day off, but the website and WeChat both failed to mention that I needed to make the res",
    "\"Very good shopping experience.",
    "Good feedback!",
    "I still believe in Amazon\u2019s self-owned products, and now it\u2019s very convenient to buy abroad. The delivery time from abroad is a few days longer than that of domestic delivery. I have to say that Amazon\u2019s clearance ability for domestic delivery after buying abroad is still very strong. It\u2019s much faster than transferring, so now I buy a lot of things abroad.",
    "I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to go out and buy them back than to buy them in the country, and I hope it will be improved.",
    "Rubbish, waste, garbage ...",
    "When you see such a package, do you think it is garbage on the roadside?",
    "A plastic packaging that is easy to break, and is sent from Germany in a plastic bag, is this packaging responsible?",
    "I think this kind of packaging is the same as garbage, and buying this product, the packaging is very simple, there is no measure to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after it arrives, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.",
    "If I only encountered one like this, I would have known, I bought a few like this, I contacted Amazon customer service, the customer service said that I could return it, but I had to pay the shipping fee, and then the shipping fee was returned to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I ask, if I pay the shipping fee with cash, you give me a gift card, is it that I have to buy your gift card myself, and then I have to mail the product to your warehouse in Germany, isn\u2019t it that I have to suffer for buying a product!",
    "I have been telling the customer service that the problem is the responsibility of someone, but the customer service did not dare to take responsibility even for half a sentence, so what guarantee does the after-sales service have? One sentence: I know! But I estimate that Amazon will not give me the opportunity to publish this evaluation, so I will directly delete it!",
    "Quality is good 5 stars, logistics is bad",
    "1, the quality is good, it is a killer, the price is reasonable, it is worth more than it costs.",
    "2, solid, enough material, welding points are solid, surface treatment is appropriate, color is good.",
    "3, logistics is a hardship, the order was placed on the 3rd, and it arrived on the 11th.",
    "4, if Amazon did not mark the estimated delivery time as February 7, I might be satisfied.",
    "5, but the expected delivery time is marked, which is equivalent to a commitment to the user, and when the commitment cannot be fulfilled, the user is very difficult.",
    "6, if you have no guarantee to make the promise, please do not make the promise.",
    "7, Actually, I care a lot about the promises made by the seller.",
    "8, so I ordered the low score.",
    "The gold line will fall",
    "The effect is still there, but whether it is obvious or not depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.",
    "The only thing that is not good is the gold line, which was designed to look good, but in fact, this gold line will fall off, and if you put it on the car, you will find that there is some gold powder on your hand and the car.",
    "Hopefully future versions of these products will be better in that regard.",
    "This rectangular one also has no decorative effect, so don't put gold lines on it, and it's troublesome to fall off and dirty the car.",
    "The goods are fine, the speed is okay, and the two packages are different packaging.",
    "The speed is fast, but it is divided into two packages, and the packaging is different, and it is obvious that one is too much shockproof, and the thick paperboard is pasted, and the layer of plastic is sealed, and the outer packaging is also convenient to disassemble, and it is like the domestic express box, and a few buffer airbags are enough, and it feels a little sloppy.",
    "I really like the Yalan mattress.",
    "The 34cm mattress is not as thick as the usual one, and you can sleep on the bed directly.",
    "The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, sleeping is very comfortable, I fell asleep very quickly when I lay on it.",
    "After receiving the mattress, there were some stains due to violent transportation by the courier, but the customer service of Yalan was responsible and efficient in contacting and solving the problem.",
    "It is not self-owned products, Amazon is shameless.",
    "The page clearly indicates self-owned, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, and after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there is a problem, you should contact the supplier yourself.",
    "If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier, and it cannot be canceled; if you want to return and exchange, sorry, Amazon has successfully applied for return and exchange, but no one will help you, and you need to contact the supplier to return the goods.",
    "Where Nima is moving?",
    "The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and after-sales service is not provided by Amazon, and the customer service said, \u201cI will contact the supplier for you\u201d, and even claimed that it is self-owned, it is too shameless, it is naked and does not want to face, and it is naked and cheats consumers!",
    "A depressing experience",
    "The filter element I bought from another website was also good, and I didn\u2019t see any water stains even after 28 days.",
    "Because the quality of the things I always buy on Amazon is good, I thought I would buy it here this time. This is the first time I have bought a filter on Amazon, and I feel that it is not very good. Not only did the water stains start early, but the filter also had floating black carbon powder after using it for 28 days. I don\u2019t know if I should continue using it or just throw it away. It\u2019s really depressing",
    "Nice to see I was missed , she thought.",
    "Compared to the plug-in board I used before, the external workmanship is average, and I haven't opened the internal to see how it is, but I hope that, as the store describes, the power supply of each independent unit is lacking",
    "The packaging was damaged, so I will wait for some time to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer packaging is damaged, but the inner packaging box seems to be new, but the manual seems to be not new, it was renovated in September, and it is in stock, I hope it will not be bad when it arrives, please explain why several customers mentioned that the packaging was damaged, but you can handle it calmly, thank you!",
    "Overall it's good, but there are some small problems",
    "This is my first purchase of a water filter jug, after reading a few reviews I felt that LAICA was a good value for money so I chose this one, I received the goods and installed the filter as described in the manual, I tried it out and it felt good overall, but when pouring water it seems that the original water mixes with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank is not very tightly sealed).",
    "Make sure to wait for all the water to pass through the filter before pouring it out!",
    "It could seem like some images are not completed.",
    "The picture didn't capture the details of the side, the side details are not consistent with the main body style, there is a big difference, this is one; this bead is made in Thailand, there is no indication of the place of origin, this is two; there is no indication of the quality, this is three; I bought it in the UK, it was clearly in a box, here it is just a simple plastic bag, and there is no product",
    "Be careful when buying, especially if you buy from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is great",
    "I ordered two days ago and today I found out that the price was reduced by 40 dollars. I spent a lot of time trying to find customer service. The customer service said that they could not refund the difference, but I could reorder and return the item.",
    "This kind of customer experience and service is really different from that of Chow Tai Fook.",
    "It's okay, it's worth buying as a newbie",
    "It looks good, and it\u2019s not as good as the Gongjin, but I\u2019ve seen the price at the mall before, and it\u2019s several hundred yuan, so I\u2019m the first time to play Gongjin, it\u2019s okay.",
    "What a relief!",
    "The goods are really good, I sent it to my girlfriend, but it was a little unpleasant when I was not at home in the afternoon when the courier came, and the courier company directly put the parcel in the post office and did not send me a confirmation message that the parcel was delivered, so I had to run twice.",
    "However, the baby is indeed good.",
    "It's worth buying, it's worth reading.",
    "The monkey is cute, and Amazon has a great discount, and the Chow Sang Sang website directly sends the goods, I ordered it last night, and I received it today in the afternoon, it is really fast.",
    "The postman is also responsible.",
    "I praise!",
    "Confessions of a Customer",
    "1 I received this substandard product, and Amazon customer service told me not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.",
    "2 Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that this problem will be handled by a specialist, and he will tell you the result.",
    "You never get to contact this agent, you never get her extension, you don't have a direct line, it's only her contacting you.",
    "Tragically, I waited for almost three days, and this specialist contacted me, but my phone left, and I didn't get the specialist's call.",
    "I waited for 2 hours and didn't get the call from the specialist, so I contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service to ask her to call me.",
    "4 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do with this coffee machine that I received as a defective product!",
    "5. The products of Amazon in the United States have no problems, and shopping overseas is good, but the service of Amazon is far worse than that of Amazon.",
    "6For me, I can only continue to wait...",
    "I'm not sure",
    "Because the review said it was good, and I was looking forward to it, and I liked it when I got it, it was lightweight, but when I opened it, I found the problem, the bottom was not flat, it was raised in the middle and sunk around the edges, the oil ran to the edges, and the special fried meat I bought to open the pot was not covered by the oil, and it was a mess, I couldn\u2019t open the pot,",
    "I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but I got a pan with a non-flat bottom, but luckily Amazon provides a month of return service, so I decided to return it.",
    "I returned the dry pan, which was dry and clean, and wasted half a day.",
    "Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to realize",
    "This is a product with a very simple design style.",
    "The cube-shaped design has a slightly curved top.",
    "It should have been a very smooth line.",
    "Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.",
    "Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.",
    "The arc of the lid and the arc of the control panel do not match, and there is a difference of up to 2 mm after they are joined.",
    "It looks like a good project.",
    "But it can be said that the whole design feeling is destroyed.",
    "I feel a little sorry for the product designer.",
    "It seems that the product manager of Midea is not capable of creating such high-quality products.",
    "(Of course, we cannot expect too much from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales lady say that all the individual products are like this, and not just the one I bought has problems, her nonchalant and truthful attitude made me realize that we cannot expect too much from Midea either) 2019-7-7 The pump is faulty and the water output is low, and it has already been repaired",
    "After the discount, it is worth buying, and the fake discount of Amazon is sad",
    "Baby was born a week ago, and it's very strong in terms of insulation.",
    "There is no heat on the outside of the pot, so it can effectively protect the temperature from being lost.",
    "The air conditioning still kept the temperature high after a whole night.",
    "Amazon said that the annual event 320 offers, but later found that everyone has 249, 289, 299, and I felt cheated at the moment, but I compared it with the supermarket and it was still cheaper than various brands at the same price, so I can take it with me when I go out in the future.",
    "Vitamix 6300",
    "I have been waiting for a long time, and I saw that the price of the Vitamix 6300 was discounted, and the price of the Chinese and foreign products was the same, so I quickly bought it.",
    "I placed an order on September 2nd, and it was expected to arrive on September 21st, but it arrived on September 12th, which was about 10 days earlier, so it was really fast!",
    "The box is not big, and I directly used the original packaging of Vitamix, and Amazon is not afraid that it will be broken when it is shipped across the ocean!",
    "The machine looks new and complete, but the cup holder is shaky, I was afraid that the cup would fly out when I turned on the machine!",
    "I asked a friend who has a 5200, and he said it was not as easy as it sounds.",
    "The recipe booklet that came with it is all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn\u2019t find a Chinese version online, which is a pain!",
    "After receiving the goods, I immediately bought a transformer, and I estimated that it would arrive in 3 days, so I will torture it well at that time!",
    "It's too small, no cover, and the material is average.",
    "It's not a big one at all!",
    "The second Totes, 1. This one has no umbrella cover 2. The umbrella handle material is average 3. It is written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and I guess it is enough for two people.",
    "On the contrary, the one I bought from Meiya before can be used by three people without pressure.",
    "I just think it's not right.",
    "First, the box is not very solid and deforms when you press on it, second, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS from scratching the surface of the box when you lay it flat, third, the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around a rod, and so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally, the laces are a bit stiff.",
    "PS: The wheels feel really good.",
    "I can still do it.",
    "Pros: This double shoulder bag is more exquisite and durable.",
    "Cons: The QR code on the card can\u2019t be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6 inch laptop can\u2019t be put in (it\u2019s too long), the shoulder bag has a buckle that can be locked, but the seller didn\u2019t prepare a lock for the buyer, which is not customer-oriented.",
    "It's okay overall, I don't know if it's genuine leather",
    "Overall it feels good, I don't know if it's real leather so I can't judge it.",
    "It can hold A4 size documents, and 80 pages thick, but I guess it can't hold a box-shaped object that is too thick and hard (not deformable).",
    "The bag is soft, and the inner pocket is also divided in a more humanized way, so it's still pretty good.",
    "It's just that there's a small scratch on the bottom of the one I got, so I don't know if it's because I'm not good at taking care of things or what.",
    "I was too lazy to go back and exchange it, so I just put up with it.",
    "Overall, I\u2019d give it four stars, it\u2019s worth it.",
    "ForRoyal is popular all over the world. Camera strap. Single lens reflex camera strap.",
    "The strap is designed scientifically, hangs on both shoulders, practical, and the camera is fixed and protected by soft material on the chest, unlike other quick-shooters that use screws to fix the bottom and hurt the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off the camera.",
    "Garbage after-sales service",
    "I bought a guitar a month and a half ago, and it was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me a phone number for after-sales service. After multiple communications, the part still hasn\u2019t arrived. What kind of efficiency is this?",
    "I guess it will be more troublesome to repair the problem later, so I hope the friends who have good after-sales service will still go around, it is too troublesome!",
    "There are some small flaws, but the sound is good.",
    "The head of the guitar has a defect, it lacks a corner, it feels like a second-hand product, there are no gifts, but the price is already not bad, and the sound of the guitar is not bad.",
    "It's okay, the first menu",
    "I have used it for a long time, and it is generally not bad, except that the bass is not coming out.",
    "The workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.",
    "The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the goods, all the lights were flashing and it couldn't be used.",
    "I asked for a replacement, and it took three days for the goods to arrive in Shanghai, but they still haven\u2019t been delivered.",
    "I didn't answer the phone to my boss.",
    "The courier company said that they only have that contact method.",
    "Amazon couldn't find the complaint.",
    "No request was made, and in the case of a delay in delivery, the message came that the delivery was delayed at my request - this is the message that came.",
    "Then it said something about a transfer issue.",
    "At this point, the poor shopping experience and the doubts about the efficiency of Amazon's logistics and control systems began to mount.",
    "I guess I won't get it today either.",
    "The label is too weak and not waterproof",
    "Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the content printed is not waterproof, and there is no film on the surface; and the label adhesive is poor, it is not suitable for cable labeling at all, it is very easy to fall off, and friends who buy it to organize cables need to pay attention.",
    "The pen is okay, but the packaging is too simple, just a paper box, there is no protection, and the box that the pen is put in is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the glue is still on the box.",
    "It's a pity that the product worth RMB 600 is treated like this, and it's a disappointing shopping experience.",
    "However, the pen is not a problem.",
    "I hope they improve the packaging!",
    "The quality is not bad, but if you talk about writing, it is not as good as 925-25.",
    "First, I have to praise the speed of delivery of the air cargo, it was super fast!",
    "I have always used 925-25, which is great, and I just received 925-85, which is also very beautiful, but the quality of the pen is not bad, and the pen is a bit heavy, which is not suitable for fast writing, and the pen cap adjusts the length of the pen a bit shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable than 85.",
    "So I became a loyal Amazon customer.",
    "I bought it at a super discounted price, but the result is that my child does not like the pen to write with.",
    "It was unsealed, and I tried to apply for a refund, and they actually came to pick it up for free.",
    "It's awesome.",
    "We don't advocate returning the product, but this is the only company in China that offers such service.",
    "I hope it won't be abused.",
    "I will buy all my books from here on.",
    "The headphones have a slight distortion and noise",
    "These headphones are really trash, I don't know if it's my ears that are the problem or if these headphones really aren't as good as they used to be.",
    "I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com. The sound quality was not bad, there was no noise, and the bass was not bad. I used it for more than two years and it broke. I was going to buy another one (Urbeats), after all, it still felt good.",
    "I also looked at the purple one, which looks pretty good, but when I bought it and opened it today, I felt that it was not right, and the sound was both loud and small.",
    "I thought it was because of the sound quality of the song, but after listening for half an hour, I found that the problem was serious, not only the distortion, but also the bass sound was not as good as before, and there was some noise, is it only the purple one I bought that has this problem? Or is the current manufacturing technology of headphones really not good?",
    "Very poor rating, very disappointed.",
    "I must return it tomorrow.",
    "PS: Not bad",

    "I bought the German version of DN1080 on August 14th.",
    "1. The front panel and the knobs are all plastic.",
    "2. The back panel audio input jack and speaker output terminals are not good, and it is much better to find a CD amplifier with a built-in unit that costs between 1000 and 2000 yuan.",
    "3. The cover is thin, and the transformer on my side is recessed, so I had to open the box and use my hands to restore it, and the cover and front panel are loose.",
    "4. The whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, and it is awkward to move.",
    "It feels like a Sony entry-level machine, just the workmanship, made in Malaysia.",
    "Sony seems to be more interested in outsourcing to Malaysia than to China.",
    "5. The machine is hot, the top cover is about 40-50\u00b0C when you touch it with your hand after using the two-channel two-speaker for about two hours, I don\u2019t know if the transformer is too hot.",
    "Now I use switch power supply, this stupid transformer is estimated to be 4KG.",
    "Sony should use a silent fan with active cooling inside the machine, but I only saw a large aluminum plate heat sink on the tubes after opening the box.",

    "In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and they gave me the seller\u2019s phone number. I called the seller again, and after a few attempts, I got through. They told me that the parcel was lost, and they could send me a new one immediately.",
    "Although I was very angry, I didn't say much to the seller because I needed the computer urgently.",

    "The seller said it hasn\u2019t been sent, and told me to order from another store if I\u2019m in a hurry, or wait until this afternoon if I can wait.",

    "As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for someone else, so I'll add a review later.",
    "I bought it half a year ago and used it a few times, but now it has been damaged, and I ask if it can be repaired?",
    "Because I have a desktop, I haven't used it much after I bought it.",
    "I only take it out of the suitcase when I am on a business trip and use it a few times.",
    "Recently, I found that when I connect the power, it is not charged, and I need to use my left and right hands to support the connection between the charger and the line to charge the power.",

I was ready to receive the package with a smile, but in the evening, without receiving any phone calls or messages, I checked the logistics and found that it had been signed for at noon, and it was even signed by myself!",

    "Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?",
    "I was questioning life!",
    "Finally, I went to the pickup point to pick up the computer.",
    "The specific reason is that the courier boy mixed up the two numbers, but luckily the package was not lost.",
    "I strongly suggest Amazon not to use EMS, and I will definitely not buy from Amazon again if Amazon uses EMS for delivery in the future.",
    "The goods are not bad.",
    "First of all, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was on sale, so I gave it a bad review. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s a good price, the CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a large number of single-player games, the heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little dim (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive",
    "(I\u2019d like to add that when buying keyboard stickers, you should definitely not buy them from a store called E Cool Digital Center in Alibaba, which is slow to ship, has poor quality, and won\u2019t refund or replace products with problems, and the boss is also rude, so I\u2019d like to expose them)",
    "The goods are good, but the platform bureaucracy is still the same.",
    "The hard drive quality is very good, the price performance ratio is absolutely high, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, absolutely recommend buying if you don\u2019t need to use it urgently and can tolerate logistics.",
    "But I have to say that the bureaucracy of Amazon platform is still the same as before, and there is no improvement compared to the time when I swore to never use it. You can never find out the actual logistics status. Information is always sent in a few weeks. You can never complain. It's just so bureaucratic!",
    "The goods have been received for a few days, but the logistics information is that you will receive the goods in 10 days!",
    "The logistics is not thoughtful",
    "It was delivered like this, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electronics packaging was open, and I don\u2019t know if it was repackaged.",
    "No, just an FYI.",
    "I haven't tried it yet, but I always trust Philips, and I hope the battery life is longer than other brands.",
    "I searched online, and it seems that this is a common problem with water damage, and there is no warranty.",
    "Depressing!",
    "Now wrap it with plastic wrap and continue to use it, I don't know how long it can be used?",
    "I bought one that someone else had taken apart.",
    "The tax of 100 yuan for a machine that costs more than 300 yuan is indeed high, but I feel more comfortable now that it costs more than 600 yuan.",
    "When I received it, the condition of the adhesive tape was not good, it looked like it had been opened, so I took a photo, and sure enough, it opened, and when I opened it, the paper board inside was also damaged, I was worried that someone had returned it, so I quickly gave my husband a try before the anniversary, and the machine had no power at all, luckily there was no hair in the blade, otherwise I would",
    "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good to use or if there will be any problems in the short term, as the previous evaluation, the things sent out when out of stock are really not reliable!",
    "The experience is above average.",
    "It is almost top-level electric, and there are many kinds of cleaning modes, but few people will change different modes every day.",
    "I have used it for half a year and there is no problem, I brush it every day, and it is almost one week to rush.",
    "The brush head accessories are also cheap on Amazon.",
    "The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the color, the other problems that seem to be compatible are the reason for the overseas version?",
    "I hope to learn the Dafa.",
    "Very good value for money.",
    "I have used it 3-4 times.",
    "1, The consignment must be packed well.",
    "2, very simple to use, and easy to clean.",
    "3, it can be completely DIY hairstyle, which saves money.",
    "In summary, it was a very successful purchase.",
    "fake products",
    "I bought two packs last time, and it turned out that they were two different versions. Originally, the words in the left and bottom corners of the packaging were green, but one of them was not, and the words were white. As a result, the cat ate it and got diarrhea.",
    "I am not sure if the Amazon source is fake or if the employee dropped the package.",
    "I will buy it again, and if it is still fake, I will find your relevant person to be responsible.",
    "It's the crossbar!",
    "The Amazon picture shows it as a diagonal hanger, but the one I received is a horizontal hanger, isn\u2019t this cheating?",
    "I tried a few songs and it worked great.",
    "The cat likes to eat, that's the point.",
    "It's really important.\"",
    "Tight, narrow, pinching feet, and grinding feet.",
    "Not recommended.",
    "1. UN is clarks most comfortable series, but this one is too bad.",
    "Addition: Today I compared the UN series of insoles (the insoles were left in the shoes after the shoes were thrown away), and the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, the breathability is not as good as before, and it is just fake soft.",
    "2. My heel is not high, the part of the heel is about 3 inches forward from the highest point of the heel.",
    "3. I bought three pairs of Clarks abroad, only one of them is suitable.",
    "I was so scared that I deleted all the songs in my favorites.",
    "I\u2019ll try rockport again, but if it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll have to go to the ecco physical store.",
    "Second best is not good enough, and the quality control is not good",
    "First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime is very powerful for overseas purchases, and the order I placed on the 31st was delivered on the 6th.",
    "The shoes are much more beautiful than the pictures, and the leather feels good.",
    "The shoe size is a little bit bigger, 25 inch length 10.5 inch width 10.5 inch, 7.5W, the shoes are a little bit loose, but I usually like to wear shoes that are a little bit loose, and I just put a pair of insoles.",
    "Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not to be trusted, one sole has a crack and the other has various scratches and a pinhole, and the glue strip at the connection between the sole and the upper is misaligned, it\u2019s obvious that they\u2019re trying to make do with second-rate goods!",
    "I regret it a little!",
    "I bought this for 280 yuan, and this price is quite reasonable for Asics, of course, there are even lower prices if you look at the reviews.",
    "Now let's talk about the shoes, the pros: the shoes are light, running is comfortable, and they fit well, and they won't slip off.",
    "The appearance is high, but the disadvantages are also obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, and this time I bought 40.5, and there is still about one thumb distance from the front of the shoe, but it does not affect anything.",
    "This shoe is very \"narrow\", although there is still a distance left in front, but it feels tight.",
    "There is another thing, the shoes may not be breathable, and now my feet feel hot.",
    "Pressure on the back of the foot",
    "First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.",
    "My feet are standard, I wear uk7.5 running shoes, eu41.5, uk6.5 shoes, and I have bought a few pairs of Amazon\u2019s Love Walk, and they have never been uncomfortable, but these shoes are a size too big, and the length is obviously too long, but because the insole is too thick, it is still impressive to press the back of the foot, and the hiking shoes are",
    "If your feet are not particularly thin, I would not recommend buying this one.",
    "If you must buy it, you can replace the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, which is a pity.",
    "A very perfect shopping!",
    "Very satisfied, very like, Amazon overseas purchase is undoubtedly genuine, quality is very good, affordable, buy with confidence, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service is very friendly and polite, patient and efficient in solving problems, perfect in solving after-sales problems, the matching fast delivery is very convenient and reliable, the delivery master is very concerned about the customer, every time he reminds the customer to take the goods from the fast",
    "In short, we all like shopping in Amazon overseas!",
    "Absolutely terrible review!",
    "I really have nothing to say about this agent and Amazon.",
    "In the future, we should be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon.",
    "Although it has been a long time, I still have to complain.",
    "I bought it on sale in winter, for less than 200, and it has been lying in my house for months without being used.",
    "When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that it could not be connected to the bracelet, and both devices manuals said that they supported each other, but later I found that it was a problem with the heart rate strap, because I tried to connect it to another device and it still did not work.",
    "I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agent, who then asked me to pay for the device to be sent to Shanghai for testing.",
    "After almost half a month, the package was sent back to me in its original packaging, even the box was the one I used to send it!",
    "There was no response and no follow-up, and no test report!",
    "You should have told me whether it was good or bad!",
    "I called to ask, and they said that sending it back like this means that there is no problem with the device, which is good.",
    "But I still can't connect, and the agent replied: It's not their business.",
    "I am fed up with your nonsense, and I am too lazy to bother with a 200 yuan item.",
    "Seriously, wrong item.",
    "It's very wrong.",
    "The headband is good quality.",
    "Much better than Nike.",
    "And breathability is good.",
    "It's just the cap in front.",
    "It's very fine.",
    "Are you here to make fun of me?!",
    "It doesn't block the sun at all.",
    "I didn't return it because it's good for the headband function.",
    "It's not blocking the sun when worn on the head.",
    "But it's different from other headband styles.",
    "It's still useful.",
    "The quality of the product is good, Amazon lacks contract spirit, and the delivery person is good.",
    "I asked for delivery on Saturday and Sunday!",
    "Amazon's rules do not allow for deliveries on Saturdays or Sundays.",
    "I had to drive 200 miles from the field to pick up the package!",
    "Amazon, how can I love you more?",
    "The delivery person was very positive and enthusiastic.",
    "Give a thumbs up!",
    "The goods, I tried it simple, it's not bad.",
    "But I have never bought similar products before, so I can't compare!",
    "Size Shipping",
    "The workmanship is okay, but the logistics is too slow, all the shoes I bought before were delivered by DHL, but this time Apex is... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low, and I feel that the quality is higher than NIKE ADIDAS?",
    "Actually, they are all the same, so I shopped online.",
    "Size: I am 176CM tall, 68KG, my shoulders are 180CM wide, I bought M, the hem is slightly long, other than that, I wore it just fine, I see that there is a recommendation for S, are you so slim? Do you like tight clothes? I think the hoodie is still a bit loose.",
    "This size is okay.\u201d",
    "Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before purchasing and was told that I should buy xxl, and then I looked at the comments and decided to buy L, and when I received the package, I found that the size was just right, and I almost got fooled.",
    "The price of Double 11 is much more expensive than that of Black Friday.",
    "The quality of the clothes is very good.",
    "Z affordable products are a problem!",
    "The order was placed on the 18th, and the goods were only received on the 25th, which is the speed of a snail from Guangzhou to Beijing!",
    "I bought the Z-discounted goods, and the description said there were scratches, but when I received the goods, I found that there were 4 screws and nuts missing!",
    "The child didn't want to return the item, thinking it wasn't a big deal, but the accessory was a small part, and the child's grandfather couldn't find it in any of the nearby hardware stores!",
    "Grandpa finally stuck it on!",
    "It seems that I can't buy Z real cheap products in the future!",
    "The toy processing quality is not good",
    "Most of the screw holes are not aligned, and it is very difficult to screw the screws in, which shows that the processing quality is not good, and it is not known how long it can be played, because it is a promise to the child, and it will not be returned.",
    "Other comments said that it was easy to install, but is it only the one I bought that has problems?",
    "Videos are very common.",
    "Is it my bad luck?",
    "Packaging is old; workmanship is average; music is only one and only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just shaking the head bag and walking forward, no variation.",
    "This gun is of no money value.",
    "I need it urgently, so I won't return it.",
    "The toy quality is good, but the packaging is bad",
    "I received the parcel yesterday, which was bought from Amazon, and it was marked as EMS delivery, and finally it was delivered by the courier of Tmall, how many bends did it turn? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall still good?",
    "Then let's talk about the packaging, it's wrapped in a few layers of cling film, there's no plastic bubble wrap inside, and when you open it, all the parts are in a box that's empty, luckily the toy quality is good, there are no broken parts, but there are too many parts, because it's not battery-powered, it often derails when pushed by hand, and it feels like the gap between",
    "Good quality, fun",
    "It's fun to play, the component precision is high, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.",
    "The process of assembling is quite interesting, I come to assemble, my 5-year-old son comes to play, it's fine.",
    "He was laughing and having fun with it. I think I will continue to buy toys from this brand.",
    "The toy is new and the price is not bad.",
    "I watched it for Christmas, and I bought it before, it was 150 yuan more expensive, but the current delivery is a little slower.",
    "The machine is still good, they are all new.",
    "Pikachu is built-in.",
    "Then connect the Genie Ball and you will get a fantasy.",
    "It's not bad to play, it's more portable than the PS4.",
    "I already bought Zelda, I\u2019m waiting for the game, and then I\u2019ll try it again.",
    "Produce junk, sell junk, result junk service, I bought six watches to send my child, one of the fast numbers is not completely displayed, the six watches are not consistent, and there is a difference of several hours.",
    "I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch had a verification time when it was received, and they replied that it did, so why was the time so different, it must be that the watch was not accurate, in other words, it was a fake product, not what I said, it was obvious that there was a quality problem (the numbers were not complete), and they took out the watches with obvious quality problems (the numbers were not complete) to sell, and they",
    "I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and also complained that we should not buy their products at the beginning, and who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future with such products, such sellers, and such after-sales services.",
    "In short, I recommend not to buy anything from this seller, even if you buy it, it will be garbage.",
    "Amazon shipping problem",
    "After receiving the goods, I found:",
    "1, the watch box is seriously damaged.",
    "2. The watch manual is severely wrinkled.",
    "3. The watch does not work, the table lamp is also not charged and cannot adjust the time.",
    "4, contacted Amazon customer service separately, and only paid for the return shipping to the US.",
    "5.2 is because the customer service is not bad.",
    "I can only say that it is still possible.",
    "The time is not very accurate, about one second per day, and it has been almost two and a half minutes since I started using it.",
    "I used a piece of West Railway City before, and I feel that it will not be a few seconds worse in a year or two.",
    "The perpetual calendar function is pretty good, but the timing function is a bit flawed, and it is basically not used, and occasionally it will touch the timing mode.",
    "Solar Powered Sports Watch",
    "Advantages: solar charging, no need to worry about replacing the battery, world time, multiple alarms and reminders.",
    "Disadvantages: the lens is easy to scratch and dust.",
    "Price/performance ratio: The domestic price is generally between 220-300 yuan, and the overseas price is more than 180 yuan (about 1 week).",
    "Very satisfied with this watch.",
    "It must be genuine, I checked the goods at the store, the watch looks beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, the material is good, and it is also imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight, and it is not comparable to the so-called mechanical watches of three or four hundred, this is the real deal.",
    "The watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the watch comes with a jewelry certificate, the 12 on the watch face is real diamond, it is suitable for yourself to wear, and it is also very good as a gift.",
    "The Rolex watch is indeed good.",
    "The worst shopping experience ever",
    "On the night of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, so I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon Malaysia, which was in stock but not self-owned and did not increase the price (secretly happy), because it was not self-owned, the delivery was slow, and the system showed that the estimated delivery date was September 27.",
    "My wife was so upset that she didn't have a phone, so she called me at 6:30 in the morning to see if there was anything we could do. Later, I checked JD.com and saw that there was a 256G version in stock that could be delivered the same day, so I immediately ordered another one.",
    "I thought I would cancel the Amazon order right away.",
    "Because the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible for the courier to come to pick up the package in the morning, so I called customer service at around 7:30 to cancel the order, and the customer service representative replied that the order had already been canceled and that I should wait for the notification message.",
    "Okay, I will wait patiently, and when I checked my phone in the afternoon, I found that the order was still in the status of not shipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to ask them to cancel the order as soon as possible, and the customer service replied that it was already OK.",
    "At 3 pm, I checked my phone and found that the order was still there. I could not do anything but contact the customer service again to clarify that I had called three times, and asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller that the delivery must not be made!",
    "The customer service representative contacted the seller on my request, and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system, and that I should wait until the seller was familiar with the system before cancelling the order.",
    "But I was told that the seller already knew about it and would definitely not send the package, so please don't worry.",
    "When I checked the order on Monday, it showed that it had been shipped, and I was speechless.",
    "Because I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call the customer service again.",
    "The handling after that was just ridiculous, basically I would say one thing and the customer service would then do something else.",
    "The order is still in the status of refusing to accept the delivery, and is being prepared to be sent again!",
    "Does Amazon not follow up?",
    "The seller's company has received the money anyway, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.",
    "In conclusion, we will never pay for large items in advance in the future, this is too troublesome.",
    "but?",
    "I had my eye on this camera a long time ago, but I didn't buy it because of some reasons other than the price, so I bought it this time because of the bundle deal and the price is still good.",
    "After I bought it, there were no problems with the other things, but when I connected it to the software, I couldn't connect it at all, and my router is a TP router, and after I searched online, I found that many people had this problem, and I spent more than two hours changing the settings of the router, and finally I used 360WIFI as a medium to solve it, and in the meantime, I called the customer service of X",
    "Another thing worth noting is that I saw user reviews online saying that the minimum storage card supported by this camera is 8G, and smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized, so please pay attention to this.",
    "It feels good to use, the picture is still acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat, and if it is always open, it feels that this degree of heat is a bit difficult to accept.",
    "In summary, there are many shortcomings in this product, and I hope that everyone will be careful when buying.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because it was bought with the first love of life, and we have been in a relationship for almost 3 years, and it has been gone for a year now.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because it was bought with the first love of life, and now I don't know how far it has been used, or maybe it has been thrown away!",
    "We were together for almost 3 years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think about her, I feel so sad that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life, she cast a shadow and sadness over my life that I still haven't been able to get over.",
    "When I bought this phone, I thought about the two feelings at that time, still able to bear hardships together, but now it is unbearable to look back, maybe life is like this, some people never want to meet, some things never want to know, but what can be done?",
    "Whenever I see a Samsung phone, my mind immediately goes to her, and the pain that comes with it, I have never been able to afford a phone that costs more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate, even though she was a great person, but when she changed her mind, all the promises and vows were gone.",
    "A gem among domestic brands",
    "Huawei is a high-end product in Chinese products.",
    "The low-key old general manager and the enterprise rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business style of relying on advertising operations to improve the reputation!",
    "A company without the ability to do so simply cannot do it, and would not dare to do so!",
    "It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.",
    "I bought it more than half a year ago, and it has been working well and very good.",
    "The reason why I didn\u2019t give it a full score is because once when I was using its offline navigation, it showed a positioning problem, and I eventually couldn\u2019t find the reason, but other times it worked fine.",
    "Moreover, it is very convenient to input the destination online, and after searching, it automatically designs the route. After leaving the wifi, the function of automatic offline navigation is very practical. You don't need to run the flow, and it directly communicates with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation. It's very good!",
    "Somethin' Stupid; Give Her Love",
    "Sony's low-end phone still has a good design, and it's cheap, the screen is big enough, the battery life is great, and it's very suitable for the elderly.",
    "Although it has been a long time, the machine still has no problem.",
    "However, since my Z2 was downgraded, this phone has also fulfilled its mission."
