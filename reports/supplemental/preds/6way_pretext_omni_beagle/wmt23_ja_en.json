    "I started by typing, but I got stuck on piano playing, so I practice every day from morning to night.",
    "I downloaded the recommended drivers but they didn't work, so I downloaded the ASIO drivers but I find the free piano sound to be good enough, so I use it for piano practice.",
    "I think it was a good purchase.",
    "It feels like I've been tricked by the appearance.",
    "Is there any product that is a hit?",
    "It's long.",
    "I've been using a Doushisha office chair (jump-up style armrest) for about 4-5 years, but the synthetic leather has deteriorated and become black, so I'm considering buying a non-synthetic leather jump-up style armrest chair.",
    "I've been looking at home centers and furniture stores but I can't find anything that's right.",
    "I was a bit hesitant to buy this product without being able to see it in person, but I was impressed with the design and the price on Amazon, so I decided to buy it.",
    "The box is surprisingly light and compact.",
    "Nesties have 1 backup.",
    "[Note] The hex wrench and screwdriver that come with it are covered in oil.",
    "At first, I was worried because the six-sided wrench had oil stains and the body was white, so I was worried when the oil stains came off.",
    "Completed assembly in 40 minutes.",
    "Completed and checked the product.",
    "The jumping style armrests have different stiffness for up and down movement, up and down movement is harder on the left and easier on the right, the armrests are not very good to use (no adjustment method).",
    "Adjusting the angle of a swivel headrest is weak and falls down with a \"click\" sound.",
    "The chair is made of non-recyclable high-density polyurethane foam, which feels hard and is uncomfortable to sit on (is it not flexible?",
    ")The mesh on the back support is stiffer and thinner than other mesh chairs, so it hurts your back.",
    "Small details, but the height from the seat to the ground is 530mm, not 550mm (height of the seat is important for tall people). Also, the feet of the castor are not made of steel, so there are doubts about durability.",
    "I bought a new cushion and put a tarp over the mesh part because I think it will wear out quickly.",
    "I'm 186cm/80kg and I feel like the fit in the back is good, but overall I'm not satisfied with the product, I feel like it's a product with a hit or miss.",
    "I think it's better to see the real thing and sit on it before buying.",
    "I got a welcome email from the manufacturer on Amazon, should I ask about the armrests and headrests?",
    "Under consideration.",
    "What is this?",
    "I bought a cheap 4K TV tuner with low expectations because I thought the right rotating BS4K would be visible.",
    "As an experiment, I can watch the free broadcast of NHK BS4K, which rotates clockwise, and I can enjoy it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV I bought at the same time.",
    "(Sometimes the video gets choppy) I just got it and the update came right away and I'm watching some recorded shows that are now compatible, but I'm wondering if the external 2.5\" HDD is affecting it at all, because when I play it the video just stops and there's frame skipping.",
    "The user interface is far from praised and is simply cut to \"4K broadcasting can be seen\".",
    "By the way, when you reserve a recording, you can only rewind and play the recording of the program, and this is also a plus function that you can record 4K on HDD.",
    "You might get disappointed if you buy a lot of things expecting them to be great, so don't have too high expectations.",
    "I hope it gets better with the update.",

    "The enter key and backspace key also stopped working.",
    "I don't recommend it at all, but if it's only 100 yen, you might as well try it.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use the half year rank.",
    "Other brands are the same price range but only offer 1 year to 3 years warranty.",
    "The short warranty period tells you how fragile it is.",
    "The product is great, but the packaging is terrible.",
    "I love these in different colors and they are my favorite.",
    "I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a food storage container!",
    "However, there are gaps in the large steps where the groceries roll over, and the delivery note was not included in the packaging, which was the worst.",
    "The lid was also out when I opened the box.",
    "I recommend this but you might find a better deal elsewhere.",
    "i'm worried about the strength, but i'll do my best.",
    "I bought it at a store that replaced the top because the support was unbearable.",
    "The lid is stable enough to serve its purpose, but it's a plastic product, so if you're not careful when opening and closing the lid, it makes a \"clack clack, (sounding like it's going to break)\" noise.",
    "You need to choose the right thickness of the gasket, so you need to be careful when buying.",
    "I like the meatballs.",
    "I have a dog and was looking for a backpack to take with me when I go out, and I was attracted to a cool gray backpack and bought it.",

    "The buttons move smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "It looks like it'll be fun even if you're moving for a long time.",
    "It folds up very compactly and easily.",

    "Light and comfortable!",
    "The slide is also very comfortable to use.",
    "First, I was attracted to the appearance and the low price, so I bought it right away!",
    "I have a few TSA locks that I like and they are convenient.",
    "And if you're looking for a celebrity known for losing keys and misplacing things, I'd recommend Nabberlocks.",
    "But honestly, I think weight is my most important point, but if you want durability and security, the screws will be loose for a week, the fabric will be cut with a knife! If it breaks, it will break in an instant.",
    "Also, I would like to see more effort put into the areas where the fasteners meet, as they are a bit soft.",
    "If you\u2019re going abroad, I recommend bringing it on the plane with you.",

    "It felt like I was hitting my pinky.",
    "So I bought a 25cm one.",
    "when i opened it, it was huge...",
    "I tried it on and it was a little loose even with socks on.",
    "I was thinking about returning or worrying, but if I round down to 24.5 and it's not too small, I'll keep it and wear it as it is, so I'll keep it and wear it as it is.",

    "<Product construction> The fabric is sturdy and not thin, so there's no need to worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "At this price, I would be satisfied with this build, but I think the smaller one would fit better.",
    "i guess i leaked gas again...",
    "Silverkraft 25 was a gas leak, I did a valve swap and it was a pain in the ass because some of the tank was missing, but I used the valve bonder and sealed the tank and did a glue rebuild and it plays great now, if you want to buy this Silverkraft 25 I recommend you to be someone who can disassemble and reassemble, I don't recommend it to people who don't have",
    "i thought 188 yen, what quality is this?",
    "You can use it for both quick replies and chatting.",
    "Light and small, and most importantly, simple.",
    "No glue included and I thought it was a bit pricey at 188 yen.",
    "It all depends on durability.",
    "You may not use it often, but I think it's a good tool to have in your toolbox.",
    "I bought it with the \"1/4 Inch Six Lobe Magnetic Quick Release Driver Bit Holder 60/100/150 mm\" from the same seller.",
    "No problem, and for the price, it was a great deal.",
    "the controller stops moving",
    "The player's ship will move on its own and become uncontrollable.",
    "When you reconnect the cable you can play but after a few minutes the drone will start moving in random directions and you can't control it anymore.",
    "Don't buy this product.",
    "I'm just warning you all.",
    "It's a cool product.",
    "It's wired, but I'd recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable and I've been using it for a long time and it still hasn't broken.",
    "You can use it for PC games too.",
    "...update 1 I'm glad I was able to get an Amazon gift card refund for it as a return within 1 month of receiving it, so that was good.",
    "Does this mean that the computational power is up?",
    "I think he's a kid who understands the math.",
    "Wouldn't it be impossible without a child who can understand calculations to some extent?",
    "I can't solve this problem.",
    "Also, when you give tools to your parents, do you point at the screen and raise them up? I tried it myself, but it doesn't work smoothly no matter how many times I do it.",
    "I guess it depends on how well you know DS?",
    "I can't stand the illustrations of manga characters, and I think it's because DS and such have a certain charm to the screen, but for some reason I can't get attached to them.",
    "The way they calculate it is also like a race against time, for example, how many questions can you answer in x minutes.",
    "I understand the feeling of being rushed during exams, but it shouldn't make you anxious and calculate?",
    "I don't know why, but I like the sound of the gong when it's over.",
    "Why not make it sound more pleasant, even though you're working hard?",
    "This makes 6,200 yen seem like a waste of money.",

    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "The characters in Persona 3 have been HD-ized, so when I first saw them, I was moved.",
    "Somehow, the Sequel Platinum looks like a megane (lol)  Persona 5 is already beautiful, so freshness is...  If you think about it, the 3rd one is a better deal.",
    "As a sound, I found 5 to be more playable than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is blue, but the background is too dark to see.",
    "The 5 is in bright colors like red and yellow, so it stands out even when it's behind the background.",
    "I think it's great for people who aren't good at music because it has a lot of assist features.",
    "Audio experts might find the challenge mode makes for a more teeth-friendly game.",
    "There's a Santura in the Triple Pack, but it's not just a bonus, it's a full 4-piece set, so if you like Pearlsona's songs, I recommend this.",

    "I used it with the iPhone 7s with no SIM card.",
    "In the first setting, I didn't know what to do after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM card, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport and she taught me (Settings > Mobile Communication > Turn on Data Roaming from the communication options).",
    "The product description didn't seem to have much to do with the product...?",
    "However, the area around Kansai Airport has poor signal, so I couldn't get 3G.",
    "When I go out in the city, it switches to 4G.",
    "Sometimes in the evening or at night, communication gets really heavy, but I think it might have reached a limit of a few hundred MB a day.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I used the Softbank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim free and used it on Ymobile, but when the Z4 started to get old, I was thinking of buying a used Xperia, but I found this phone that can be used with a new sim free phone and bought it.",
    "I was using Mobile Suica, so I was worried if it would work, but it was fine.",
    "The size, weight, and silver color make it look like an iPhone6 to me.",

    "I thought it was amazing like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase after upgrading to Android Ver9.",
    "What I like:  A little smaller would be better  No straw hole *For cases with a straw hole  I haven't tested waterproofing  A little heavy  I'm satisfied with it even though I haven't used it much, I recommend it"
