    "Approximately 3.56 million people were addicted to drugs in 2018, and the risk is greater for those with lower incomes.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of developing substance abuse disorders, and exacerbate their consequences. Research from high-income countries has proven this point. In these studies, an individual's unfavorable social economic background is not only a factor at a given point in time but also related to the risk of substance abuse disorders.",
    "Drug addiction deepens social-economic disadvantages, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby reinforcing the vicious cycle of poverty. These consequences may also be related to the discriminatory attitudes and outcomes within the criminal justice system.",

    "Global data indicate that being under the influence of drugs can be a significant factor in causing homicides.",
    "In violent events, the impact of alcohol seems to be greater than that of drugs.",
    "Although drug use may lead to criminal activities, in some cases, this relationship can be partially attributed to various intermediary factors such as social-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.",
    "The relationship between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a well-established criminal structure, including large-scale organized crime involving drug trafficking, it is possible for such activities to be carried out without violence.",
    "In the short term, the existence and degree of violence is more determined by the quantity of trafficking, rather than by certain changes that disrupt the power balance between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the scale of the black market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, or law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.",

    "The synthesized opioids' non-medical use aggravates the public health crisis.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is caused by tramadol; in North America, it is caused by fentanyl. These regions have almost no commonalities in economic, population statistical data, or general patterns of drug use, but they are both struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily obtainable and low-cost opioid analogues.",
    "In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has caused a significant increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.",
    "In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths recorded in the United States involved fentanyl.",

    "But in 2018, after India passed a law for regulating tramadol, global seizures dropped to 32 tons.",
    "The causes of these crises are the ease of manufacturing and lower production costs for these substances, in addition to the lack of international regulation for tramadol and many fentanyl-like substances.",
    "These two crises were exacerbated by the fact that these substances were in supply both in the legal pharmaceutical market and the illicit market, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.",
    "The use of stimulants is on the rise.",
    "The stimulant domain is led by cocaine and methamphetamine, and the usage quantities of both substances are on the rise in their primary markets.",
    "Approximately 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 due to its popularity in North America and Western Europe.",
    "In the same year, approximately 2,700 million people used methamphetamine, among which methamphetamine, specifically methamphetamine with the chemical structure of D-methamphetamine, was the most widely used form in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to various indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.",
    "In some markets, the use of cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other. When the use of one substance increases, the use of the other substance may decrease, satisfying the same market demand at different times.",
