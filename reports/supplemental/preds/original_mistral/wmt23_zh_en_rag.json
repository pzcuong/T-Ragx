Even peripheral characters like Ji\u0101ngb\u014d T\u00fa Ch\u016bxi\u00f9 are popular.

For budget-limited, non-art specialist readers, this version offers",

    "While reading this book, images of quarreling couples next to you, tasteless marriages of acquaintances, and unsatisfying relationships may resurface in your mind.",
    "This is the reason I don't recommend reading this book, from a critical perspective, the writing and plot are bland and uninteresting. Unless your life is chaotic and exciting like living in Sugar Town, or overly sweet, your reading experience will feel strange and boring.",
    "From a philosophical perspective, the daily events did not illuminate or broaden one's thoughts and horizons (this differs from Marquez's \"Love in the Time of Cholera\"), and the brief fragments did not delve into any issues, such as what kind of error led to the failure of love?",
    "What is the reason for the protagonist's marriage breakdown?",

    "Explained many sales theories as what and why, but was weak in how-to aspects, only indicating directions without providing specific methods.",
    "Additionally, this book feels like it was pieced together.",
    "For instance, there are both domestic and foreign ones; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople, as well as those unknown but influential.",

    "The author expounded on the five languages of praise in this book: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Acts of Service, Thoughtful Gifts, and Physical Touch.",
    "I believe the important thing is not that you know the five languages of appreciation by heart, but that you can spontaneously and sincerely express your appreciation using these five languages for the people around you, be it family, friends, or colleagues.",

This is the worst shopping experience from Amazon that I have had, and I have already applied for a refund. This is a feature of substandard products from Amazon; I suggest merchants keep their eyes open and refuse substandard goods. Supplement: I also bought",
