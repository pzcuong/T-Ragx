    "On a desk, it will fly with its own wind power, but if you put a handkerchief over it, it's fine.",
    "Sound, you don't notice it in the outside/family type places but in the office, even \"small\" is too loud.",
    "It's just for when you go out, so you need to have a separate allowance for that.",
    "Also, the office user said that it is too cold and too much airflow even with the small size.",
    "It's perfect for when you're sweating your ass off at the exit and dart into Family Mart to cool down with a \"large\".",
    "One thing to note is that sometimes when you put it in your bag, the power button gets pressed and it turns on without you knowing.",
    "I think it's a good idea to have tricks like slightly pulling the button in (sinking it), or making the first press weak to make a long press.",
    "It's a must have item in the dangerous heatwave, so it would be great if you could make a better one.",
    "Multifunctional Light Speaker",
    "I put the weakest warm color in my bedroom and use it.",
    "it's better than i thought!",
    "I'm glad I bought it.",
    "As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color with a touch.",
    "White color is suitable for any room and the color light changes in gradation, so it is beautiful.",
    "Also, you can touch it in your favorite color and it will stop at your favorite color, so you can light it up according to your mood!",
    "LED so it should have a long lifespan.",
    "As for sound quality, I think it's more than enough for my amateur ears.",
    "Another great thing about this light is that it\u2019s multifunctional.",
    "\u2022 The top has a large speaker.",
    "It can be paired with mobile phones and Bluetooth devices, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.",
    "\u2022 Pair your phone with it for hands-free calling.",
    "- It also supports MicroSD, so you can connect it to your computer and play music as an mp3 player.",
    "The Piano Practice and the Punching Bag",
    "I started DTM at 66 years old to prevent baldness.",
    "Purchase the audio interface and your instrument.",
    "I started by typing but got stuck on piano playing and practice all day long.",
    "I downloaded the recommended audio source but it didn't work, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but I found that the free piano audio source has a good sound, so I use it for practicing the piano.",
    "I think it was a good purchase.",
    "It feels like you're being tricked by the appearance.",
    "Is it a product that misses the mark?",
    "It's long.",
    "I've been using a Doushisha office chair (bouncing armrest) for 4-5 years and the synthetic leather has deteriorated and become rough, so I'm considering buying a non-synthetic leather bouncing armrest chair.",
    "I've been looking at home centers and furniture stores, but I can't find anything that's right.",
    "I was a little nervous about buying something I couldn't see in person, but I decided to go for it based on the design and price and bought it on Amazon.",
    "The box is surprisingly light and compact.",
    "There is one spare screw.",
    "[Note] The hex wrench and screws that come with it are oily.",
    "At first, I couldn't see any oil on the hex wrench because the body was white, so I got worried when I saw oil on it.",
    "Completed assembly in 40 minutes.",
    "Completed and checked the product.",
    "The jumping style armrests are different in hardness on the left and right, the left is heavy and the right is light, making the armrests difficult to use (there is no way to adjust them).",
    "Adjusting the angle of a quick release head is weak and falls quickly with a \"click\" sound.",
    "The seat is made of non-recyclable high-density polyurethane foam and feels hard, making it uncomfortable to sit on (is it not elastic enough?",
    ") The mesh on the back support part is harder than the mesh on other mesh chairs, so if you wear thin clothing, your back will hurt.",
    "Small details, but the height from the seat to the ground is 530mm not 550mm (height of the rider is important for the seat height) and the part that supports the caster is not made of steel, so there are questions about durability.",
    "I bought a new cushion and put a towel over the mesh part because it seems like it will wear out (get damaged) quickly.",
    "I'm 5'6\" 180lbs and I feel like the fit is only good in the back, I feel like it's a low quality product and it's off in the fit.",
    "I think it's better to see the real thing and sit on it before buying.",
    "I got a welcome email from the manufacturer so I'm going to ask about the armrests and headrests?",
    "Under consideration.",
    "What is this?",
    "My home environment seems to be right for a right-handed BS4K, so I bought a cheap Pixel 4K tuner without too much expectation.",
    "As an experiment, I can watch the free broadcast of NHK BS4K, which rotates clockwise, and I can watch it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV I bought at the same time.",
    "(Sometimes the video is jerky) I just bought it and it updated right away and now it's recording compatible so I'm trying it out with some scheduled recordings, but I'm wondering if the external 2.5\" HDD is affecting it, because it's stuttering during playback, with the video freezing and skipping frames.",
    "The user interface is not praised at all, and it is simply cut to \"You can watch 4K broadcasting\".",
    "By the way, when you reserve a recording, you can only replay the program you're recording, and this is also considered a plus feature that you can record 4K content on the HDD.",
    "Don't have too high expectations, or you'll be disappointed when you buy it.",
    "I hope they improve it with an update.",
    "the warming function is ok.",
    "I haven't used the warming function yet, but I put in two 500ml pet bottles and it warmed up in about 2 hours and was hot after 2.5 hours.",
    "I used it in the footrest of the driver's seat of a compact car, but I was worried about the fan noise when idling, but I didn't feel it at all when driving.",
    "It's new so it smells like chemicals that are being emitted by the fans. I had to open the windows regularly to ventilate.",
    "As the reviewer said, the part where the shoulder strap goes through is a bit rough, so you need to bend it with a negative driver or something.",
    "it's really fragile.",
    "I started using it today and it broke after two months.",
    "I like the feel and size of the keyboard, but it doesn't matter if it breaks.",
    "I work with video all day on my PC and the volume just randomly goes to 100%.",
    "Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.",
    "The headphones are so loud that they hurt my ears and I can't use them at night because the volume on the PC is too low.",
    "The volume display is flickering on and off on the computer screen every few seconds, as if it's sending a signal.",
    "And it's even more annoying because the mouse instructions interfere with the keyboard, so you have to turn the keyboard off every time you want to use the mouse.",
    "The enter key and backspace key also stopped working.",
    "I don't recommend it at all, but if it's only 100 yen, you might as well try it.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use the half year rank.",
    "Other brands offer 1 year to 3 years warranty in the same price range, but this one only offers 6 months warranty.",
    "The short warranty period tells you how fragile it is.",
    "The product is great, but the packaging is terrible.",
    "The product comes in different colors and is a favorite.",
    "I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a food storage!",
    "However, there is a huge gap between the large ball and the small ball, and the delivery note was not included and the packaging was the worst.",
    "The lid was also out when I opened the box.",
    "I recommend this product but you might want to buy it somewhere else.",
    "i'm worried about the strength, but at least",
    "I bought it at the place where I exchanged the cover because the support became unbearable.",
    "It does its job of being stable, but since it's a fancy plastic lid, it makes a \"clack clack, (sounding like it's going to break)\" noise when you open and close it.",
    "You need to choose something that matches the thickness of the gasket, so you need to be careful when buying.",
    "I like meatballs.",
    "I have a dog and was looking for a backpack to take with me when I go out and I was attracted to this gray stylish backpack so I bought it.",
    "It's a snap together design and it's surprisingly lightweight, so it doesn't feel heavy when you hold it.",
    "The buttons move smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "It looks like it'll be fun even if you're moving for a long time.",
    "It\u2019s very compact and easy to fold up.",
    "Even when folded, the meatball design is visible and it's cute when placed.",
    "Light and comfortable!",
    "The slide is also very comfortable to use.",
    "First, I was attracted to the appearance and the low price, so I bought it!",
    "TSA lock is my favorite for the past few years and I have a few more that are convenient.",
    "And for the key forgetters and the misplaced, I recommend number lock.",
    "But honestly, I think the most important point is the weight, and it's good that it's light, but if you want durability and security, the stitching at the buttonhole will come undone after a week, and you'll be done for it in an instant with a knife!",
    "Also, the buttonholes are a bit too close together, so I'd like to add some spacing.",
    "If you\u2019re going abroad, I recommend bringing it on the plane with you.",
    "At least, I used it for a shinkansen trip and it was comfortable.",
    "It's hard to choose the size...",
    "It's hard to buy shoes because there are so many options.",
    "The conversation and bunz are 24cm.",
    "MRL996 is also 24cm.",
    "I thought it was small at first, but once you get used to it, it's fine.",
    "The ML574 I got this time was too small for my sister, who said it was too small at 24.5cm, but it was indeed small.",
    "It felt like a finger was hitting it.",
    "So I bought a 25cm one.",
    "when i opened it, it was huge...",
    "I tried it on and it was a little loose even with socks on.",
    "I was thinking about returning it but I thought it was a bit small at 24.5 so I decided to keep it at 25 and try it out.",
    "I bought the team led and it\u2019s a great red color!",
    "There are many monotone clothes in black and white, so wearing them will make you look brighter!",
    "height 165 cm, male, 40s",
    "I ordered the L size but I recommend the M size for the same specs.",
    "Height: 165 cm  Weight: 60 kg  Waist: 81 cm  Hips: 100 cm  Typical metabolic belly.",
    "<Usage>  In water, the waist part is loose, so the rush guard is flapping up.",
    "I'm swimming while fixing the part that flipped up.",
    "Especially if you're slacking on the diet, you can see the metabolic belly.",
    "Also, if you walk with a lot of up and down movement, it will still curl up from the bottom.",
    "<Product Making> The fabric is sturdy and not too thin, so I don't worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "For the price, I'm satisfied with the quality, but I think the smaller size would fit better.",
    "i guess i leaked gas again...",
    "Silvercolt 25 was leaking gas, I replaced the valve and it caused a problem where part of the tank was missing, I used the busbond q and sealed the tank and did the repair grisu and it was able to be played again, I would recommend this silvercolt 25 to anyone who can take it apart and put it back together, I don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the confidence to take it apart while",
    "i thought 188 yen, what kind of quality is this?",
    "You can use it for both early morning and conversation.",
    "Light and small, and above all, simplicity without any decoration.",
    "There's no glue when you attach the bit, and I thought it was a great cost performance for 188 yen.",
    "It's all about endurance from here on out.",
    "You may not use it often, but I think it's a good tool to have in your toolbox.",
    "I bought it with the same seller's \"1/4 Inch Six-Lobe Magnetic Quick Release Driver Bit Holder 60/100/150 mm\"",
    "No problem here, and for the price, it was a great deal.",
    "The controller stops working",
    "Your ship will move on its own and you won't be able to control it.",
    "When you reconnect the cable you can play, but after a few minutes the drone will move in a random direction and you won't be able to control it anymore.",
    "I would not buy this product.",
    "I'm just warning you all.",
    "It's a cool product.",
    "It's wired, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable and I've been using it for a long time and it still hasn't broken.",
    "You can use it for PC games too.",
    "...addendum  I was happy that I was able to get an Amazon gift card refund for a return within 1 month of the purchase.",
    "So this is the calculation power?",
    "I think he's a kid who understands the math.",
    "I think it's impossible to understand calculations without a certain level of understanding.",
    "I can't solve this problem.",
    "Also, when giving tools to parents, I have to move the screen items with my finger, but I tried it myself, and it doesn't work smoothly no matter how many times I do it.",
    "I wonder if it's easy to explain to people who are familiar with DS?",
    "I can't seem to like the illustrations of manga characters, and I think it's because DS and such games are so interesting that you get drawn into the screen...  I don't know why I can't get attached to them.",
    "The way we calculate is also competing with time, for example, how many questions can you answer in x minutes.",
    "I understand the need to rush through tests, but can't you at least try to not stress yourself out while calculating?",
    "I don't know why, but I like the gong that sounds when it's over.",
    "Why not make it sound more pleasant, even though you're working hard?",
    "I feel like I lost 6200 yen.",
    "I understand if it's half the price.",
    "sorry, this translation made it 2 stars.",
    "Persona songs are good!",
    "Persona 3 got to ED.",
    "I played up to 5.",
    "Persona 4 is fully trophy unlocked on vita.",
    "The things you can do are the same as in the previous Persona 4.",
    "The reason there is no story is because it feels shorter than the previous one.",
    "The song is still cool!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "The characters in Persona 3 were HD for the first time, so I was moved the first time I saw them.",
    "Somehow, Shunpei looks like an ikemen (lol) Persona 5 is already great, so it's not freshness... thinking that way, 3 feels more worth it.",
    "As a music game, I felt like 5 was more fun than 3.",
    "Persona 3 has a blue theme, but the background was too dark to see.",
    "The 5 is in bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even when it's behind the background.",
    "It has a lot of assist features, so I think even people who are bad at rhythm games can play it.",
    "Sound game veterans might find the challenge mode makes the game more challenging.",
    "The triple pack has Santa on it but it's not a cheap set of 4, so if you like Persona's music, I recommend this.",
    "i'm sorry.",
    "I bought this because I liked the color of the letters on the photo, but the actual product is a dark blue, closer to black or charcoal gray.",
    "and it wasn't a double backflip.",
    "I was thinking about buying gold too, but I'm holding off for now. The price is so low, I can't help but think about it.",
    "Update: After the review was published, I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange for a new product.",
    "The rest of the process was quick.",
    "I think they did a great job with the cheap products.",
    "Added 4 stars for the response. Also bought gold.",
    "The color is almost exactly like the photo and I think it's very nice.",
    "But still, the backlash is not a double lock, and the difference between the description and the photo is clear.",
    "That's the only downside.",
    "Evenings get really heavy.",
    "I used it with the iPhone 7s with no SIM card.",
    "In the first setting, I didn't know what to do after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM card, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport and she taught me (Settings > Mobile Communication > Communication Options > Turn on Data Roaming).",
    "The product description didn't seem to have much to do with the product...?",
    "However, the area around Minami-Kuju Airport has poor signal, so I couldn't get 3G.",
    "When I go out in the city, it switches to 4G.",
    "Sometimes in the evening or at night, the communication got really heavy, but I think it might have reached a few hundred MBs a day.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I used the Softbank Z4 for 2 years, unlocked it and used it with Ymobile, but the Z4 was getting old, so I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that I can use with a new SIM-free phone, so I bought it.",
    "I was using mobile Suica so I was worried if it would work, but it was fine.",
    "It's big, heavy, and I bought silver so it gives the impression of iPhone6?",
    "No game so processing speed is the same as Z4, but it seems a bit faster  In the review, it was said that the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so I use face recognition which is faster.",
    "I thought it was great, like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase after upgrading to Android 9.",
    "What I like:  A little smaller would be better  No strap hole ( * This is for cases with strap holes)  I haven't tested waterproofness  A little heavy  I haven't used it much yet, but I'm satisfied with it. I recommend it."
