    "The human sensing sensors detecting human movement from the temperature difference between the person and the surrounding are installed in three places in the ceiling of the car.",
    "When the vehicle's engine is turned off and the door is closed, and a person's movement is detected after a certain time has passed, a warning notification is automatically sent.",
    "The system is able to prevent the error detection by linking the information with the status of the engine and the door.",

    "In addition to calling the number registered in advance, the message is displayed in the chat on the computer or smartphone.",

    "I bought an audio interface and this device.",
    "At first, I was just a drummer, but I became addicted to playing the piano and practice every day.",
    "I have taunted the commissioned sounds, and I have tried to protect them. At first, I taunted ASIO, but I used free piano sounds because they sounded good, and I use them for piano practice.",
    "I'm glad I bought it.",
    "I feel like I was deceived by the appearance.",
    "What is the product?",
    "It's a long text.",
    "The synthetic leather of the office chair ( jumping armrest ) made by Toshiba which was used for 4~5 years deteriorated and became hollow, and the purchase examination was made by the chair with the jumping armrest made of non-synthetic leather.",
    "I looked around at home improvement stores and furniture stores, but there was nothing suitable.",
    "If you are worried about not being able to check the actual product, you can compromise on the appearance of the design and the price and buy this product on Amazon.",

    "Completion and product verification.",
    "The hardness of the armrests is different from left to right and from top to bottom, and the left armrest is heavy and the right armrest is light, and the armrest is not convenient to use (there is no adjustment method).",
    "The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has a weak retaining force and drops down to the floor with a \u201cclick\u201d sound.",
    "The seat is made of non-recycled high-density polyurethane foam, which is hard to feel and not comfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?",
    "The backrest is made of a hard sports mesh, which is harder than other mesh chairs, and it hurts the back when wearing a thin clothing.",
    "The height from the seat to the ground is 530mm, not 550mm (the height of the seat is important for a tall person).",
    "I use a cushion that I bought separately, and a towel cover on the mesh fabric part because it is likely to deteriorate (be damaged) quickly.",
    "I feel that the product is not good except for the fit of the back, which is good for me who is 186cm and 80kg.",
    "It is still better to sit down and buy an office chair by seeing it.",
    "I received an Amazon e-mail from the manufacturer, and I asked if I could contact them about the armrests and headrests.",
    "The method is under consideration.",
    "I don't know what this is.",
    "I bought a cheap 4K tuner from Hikvision because I thought that I could see BS4K in my home environment.",
    "As an experiment, I have watched free broadcasts of right-hand turn, including NHK BS4K, and have enjoyed them nicely on a Panasonic 4K TV that I bought at the same time.",
    "(Sometimes the image is cracked) I have watched some pre-recorded videos since the upgrade came out, and I think it is because of the external 2.5-inch HDD, which causes the image to stop playing and frame skipping.",
    "The user interface was not praised, and I just said that I could watch 4K broadcasts.",
    "By the way, I think that the 4K recording to the HDD is a plus feature, because during the scheduled recording, I can only play the recorded program in the tracking mode.",

    "I hope that it will improve in the upcoming updates.",
    "The thermostat's working.",

    "I installed the fan at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car.",
    "The smell of chemicals from the fan was also a concern, and the window had to be opened regularly to ventilate the room.",

    "I love the products and I like them in different colors.",
    "If you are looking for a footstoker, we highly recommend it!!",
    "However, the gaps in the big cardboard box were so wide that the box would roll and the packing was very bad, even though the delivery note was included.",
    "When I opened the box, the lid was off.",
    "I recommend the product, but you might want to buy it elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the intensity, but for now,",
    "I bought it because I couldn't stand it after I replaced the lid.",
    "It serves to stabilize the lid, but because it is a delicate plastic product, it makes a \"meki-meki\" (a sound like a broken lid) sound when you open and close the lid without paying attention.",
    "You must choose a pot that fits the thickness of the lid, so you should be careful when buying it.",
    "Meat balls cute hook",

    "TSA locks have been my favorite for a few years now and I have a few others too.",
    "And, as a master of forgetting and losing keys, I recommend the number lock.",
    "But, honestly, I think lightness is the most important point. If you want to make a bag that is durable and secure, you can use zippers instead of a zipper, and if you want to use a knife, you can use a knife instead of a cloth.",
    "I also want the zippers to be overlapped so that they look nice.",
    "If you are traveling abroad, I recommend you to take it on board the plane.",

    "My sister said that the ML574 was too tight at 24.5cm, and when I tried it, it was really tight.",
    "I felt like my little finger was hitting it.",
    "So, I bought a 25cm one.",
    "I got it and opened it, and it was big...",
    "When I tried it, it was a little loose even with socks on.",
    "I was wondering if I should return the shoes, but I think I will keep the 24.5 size and put in the 25 size sock because it would be too much trouble if I got too tight.",
    "I bought Teamlet, and it's a very good and colorful letter!",
    "I wear a lot of black and white monochrome clothes, so I wear this to brighten up!",

    "I'm going to focus on durability.",
    "I think it's a good tool to keep in your toolbox, even if you don't use it very often.",
    "I bought this tool together with the 1/4-inch Hex Shank Magnetic Quick Release Trigger Roller Hitch Holder 60/100/150 mm from your distributor.",

    "I understand how you feel when you're rushed to an exam or something... but don't you start to rush yourself to calculate?",
    "I also like the sound of the gong after the performance.",

    "The challenge function can be turned on to make the game more challenging for the skilled players.",

    "The instructions that came with the product didn't seem to be that relevant.",
    "By the way, the 3G signal was very good around the airport, which seems to be because of the poor signal quality.",
    "When I went out into the city, I got 4G.",
    "In the evenings and nights, the connection was sometimes quite heavy, and I think I might have reached a maximum of several hundred MB per day.",
