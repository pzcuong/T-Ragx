    "You can't put tools and parts in a magazine sized area and expect to work on it.",

    "(Sometimes the picture gets all jittery) I just bought it and it updated right away and now it's recording compatible so I'm trying it out with some scheduled recordings but I'm wondering if the external 2.5\" HDD is causing it to stutter, it's like the picture freezes and then skips frames.",
    "The user interface is never praised, and it is cut off as \"You can watch 4K broadcasting\".",
