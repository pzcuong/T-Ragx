    "interventions and treatment services for drug use and related risky behaviors may be severely affected if governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way.",
    "In addition, the priority of interception actions and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.",
    "Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is estimated that these countries will be most directly affected by the drug trafficking activities.",
    "Methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs are sometimes carried in a carry-on bag or hidden in personal luggage, and sometimes in large quantities. Since almost all countries have implemented restrictions on air passenger transportation, the supply of drugs by commercial aviation may be completely interrupted.",
    "Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the activities of trafficking using the dark web and parcel post may increase.",
    "In the long run, economic downturns and related lockdown measures may disrupt the drug market.",
    "As unemployment rises and opportunities dwindle, the poor and disadvantaged are more likely to turn to drugs in harmful ways, to become addicted to them, and to turn to illegal activities related to drugs, whether production or transportation.",

    "in the past two decades, the growth rate of drug abuse in developing countries has far exceeded that of developed countries.",
    "This to some extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the fact that the population of young people in developing countries grows faster.",
    "The proportion of young people and young adults in drug addicts is the largest.",

    "Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.",
    "increases in wealth are associated with increases in drug use , but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest people in the world . drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries .",
    "Drugs such as cocaine are more firmly linked to the world's wealthier regions.",
    "Similarly, within each country, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the more affluent social classes.",
    "However, the proportion of people who switched to drug addiction was higher among those with lower socioeconomic status.",
    "data from a few countries suggest that harmful drug @-@ use patterns and disorders are linked to low income .",
    "These patterns are less common in more affluent social classes.",
    "The economic constraints caused by the global Covid-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have historically been associated with increases in drug use, and this pandemic has forced millions of people around the world out of work.",
    "COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of the drug market The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, or because the control ability of the national authorities is reduced, or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.",
    "The related restrictions on the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a reduction in air and land transportation, and the maritime smuggling may have increased as a result. The risk of interception at sea is low, and the amount of smuggling by sea is more than that by air or land.",
    "There have been reports that cocaine shipments are being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.",
    "complexity enhancement",
    "The situation of non-controlled substances is stable, but the number of new types of opioids with potential harm is increasing, and the drug market is becoming more and more complicated.",
    "In addition to cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added to the list, many of which are not controlled internationally. Non-medical use of drugs is also on the rise.",
    "There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic market of member countries every year.",
    "At present, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.",
    "Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has been stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "In the total number of new psychoactive substances confirmed in 2014, the proportion of new psychoactive substances of the opium type was only 2%, but by 2018, this proportion had risen to 9%.",
    "many of the new psychoactive substances in the class of opioids are analogs of fentanyl , and their pharmacologic effects and harms have been documented , leading to overdose deaths in North America and elsewhere , although to a lesser extent .",
    "In North America , fentanyl is sometimes used as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs , including cocaine and methamphetamine , and sometimes used to make counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids .",
    "some evidence suggests that the phenomenon of injecting new psychostimulants is also prevalent in Europe: a study of the remnants of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many of the syringes were contaminated with new psychostimulants that produce stimulant effects.",
    "2. The use of new psychoactive substances may become firmly entrenched in vulnerable groups",
    "single new psychoactive substances have rarely formed large markets.",
    "But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prisoners.",
    "22 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons , with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge .",
    "the control of precursor chemicals forces drug makers to innovate. Many chemicals that are commonly used as precursors to synthesize methamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and \"ecstasy\" have been placed under international control.",
    "Drug dealers and chemists have been looking for alternatives - not just substances that are less tightly controlled, but chemicals designed to circumvent controls, known as \"precursor chemicals.\"",
    "restrictive measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 are likely to further squeeze the drug makers who rely on precursor chemicals.",
    "evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already a reality : reports indicate that a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia in March 2020 led to increases in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States .",
    "the market is always changing",
    "Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation",
    "the market for opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018 .",
    "The number of people being treated for opioid use has fallen sharply, while the amount of opioids seized by Russian authorities has dropped by about 80%.",
    "But the stimulant market seems to be booming.",
    "there is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones , including methoxymethamphetamine and a @-@ pyrrolidinylpentedrone , are now readily available on the Russian drug market .",
    "The Russian authorities reported that the number of secret production sites for illegal drugs has increased sharply in recent years. In the past two years, the number of production sites has doubled to 152 in 2018.",
    "Methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq grows",
    "as early as 2012 , surveys of personnel in hospitals , prisons , and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq .",
    "Crystal meth has become another major drug of concern, along with fentanyl and tramadol.",
    "A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users saying that marijuana was harder to get than \"OxyContin\" or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the Drug Enforcement Administration has expressed concern about the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine-based products that are used as precursors by methamphetamine processing sites.",
    "Methamphetamine production in Afghanistan appears to have started in 2014.",
    "Since then, the amount of methamphetamine seized has been steadily rising.",
    "But the amount of ivory seized in the first half of 2019 was 6.57 tons, a sharp increase compared with the previous year.",
    "The large amount of methamphetamine seized in other countries is also evidence that the production is rapidly increasing.",
    "Policy changes and trends",
    "The jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis have a tendency to see an increase in cannabis use",
    "Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "in most of these jurisdictions , cannabis use has increased since legalization , although similar trends have been observed in jurisdictions that have not legalized nonmedical cannabis use .",
    "In the two states in the United States that first passed legislation, Colorado and Washington, the number of adults who use marijuana for non-medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and daily or almost daily use, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that marijuana use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, with use nearly doubling last month.",
    "This suggests that the increase is mainly due to frequent and regular use of cannabis.",
    "Short-term data from Canada also shows that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, so did use.",
    "However, 40% of cannabis users still get some products from illegal sources in 2019.",
    "The reason for the sharp decline in the global seizure of cannabis is the legalization of cannabis?",
    "In 2018, the global seizure of cannabis plants fell to the lowest level in 20 years, due to a drop in North America, which fell by 84% in the past decade.",
    "By contrast, seizures in other parts of the world nearly doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the market played a key role in the decline.",
    "the regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a suppressive effect on the domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances , and it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of the regulation of new psychoactive substances .",
    "countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances have shown different prevalence rates of use of these substances .",
    "in other countries , use of novel psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation .",
    "the use of opioids for pain management and palliative care is mainly provided in high @-@ income countries , and the distribution of these drugs is uneven across regions .",
    "In 2018, more than 90% of all the drugs used for medical consumption were in high-income countries.",
    "About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.",
    "These countries account for about 12% of the world\u2019s population.",
    "It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the world's population, but the consumption of opium for medicinal purposes accounts for less than 10%.",
    "obstacles to obtaining opioid medications are related to many factors , including legislation , culture , health care systems , and prescribing practices .",
    "People who are poorer are more likely to have a substance use disorder. In 2018, an estimated 3.56 million people had a substance use disorder.",
    "poverty , limited education , and social marginalization may increase the risk of substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences . this has been demonstrated in high @-@ income countries , where adverse socioeconomic trajectories -- not just a person 's circumstances at a given point in time -- are associated with the risk of substance use disorders .",
    "drug use disorders also deepen social and economic disadvantage , further increasing the risk of unemployment , poverty , and homelessness , thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle of disadvantage . These outcomes may also be related to the stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system .",
    "women , members of minority groups , immigrants , members of sexual and gender minority groups , people displaced by armed conflict or disaster , and people in rural settings may be disproportionately affected by substance use disorders or have difficulty accessing treatment services .",
    "according to the disability @-@ adjusted life @-@ year ( DALY ) metric , which estimates the number of healthy life @-@ years lost because of disability and premature death , the harmful effects of drug use have increased in the past decade and have a broader societal impact .",
    "between 2007 and 2018 , the global years of life lost attributable to drug use increased by 17 % .",
    "the increase in years of life lost to liver cancer attributable to untreated hepatitis C among injection drug users was particularly high , at 40 % .",
    "the relationship between drugs and violence is complex and difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence .",
    "limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide .",
    "But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to have a greater effect than drugs.",
    "although drug use may lead to crime , in some cases this association can be partly attributed to multiple intervening factors , such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity that are caused by individual risk , family environment , and peer influences .",
    "The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, including large-scale organized crime activities such as international drug trafficking, it is possible to carry out these activities without violence.",
    "In the short term, the presence and extent of violence are more a function of changes in the balance of power among organized crime groups than of the amount of trafficking. These changes include fluctuations in the size of the illegal market, the death or incarceration of prominent criminals, and law enforcement actions that weaken one group relative to another.",
    "the latest trend",
    "Drug abuse of marijuana is the most common substance, and the harm of opioids is the most serious",
    "An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.",
    "By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "However, the related harms of opioids are ignored because of the small number of users.",
    "of the estimated 167,000 deaths in 2017 attributable to drug use disorders , 66 % were caused by these substances , and 50 % of the 21 million years of life lost to disability or premature death from drug use were attributable to these substances .",
    "Nonmedical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis",
    "In West, Central and North Africa, the crisis is driven by tramadol; in North America, it is fentanyl. These two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but they are both struggling with a crisis fueled by a substance that is readily available and cheap to produce.",
    "in North America , the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20 @-@ year increase in the number of opioid @-@ related deaths .",
    "of the 67,367 excess deaths registered in the United States in 2018 , two thirds involved fentanyl .",
    "Canada also reported similar results, albeit at lower numbers.",
    "part of the reason for the excess deaths from fentanyl is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market .",
    "the market for nonmedical use of ketamine has grown substantially in West Africa , Central Africa , and North Africa .",
    "In this area, the number of patients with conditions treated with tramadol is increasing.",
    "In 2017, the global amount of captured curmarodone increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating curcumin, global seizures dropped to 32 tons.",
    "The two factors that have contributed to the crisis are the ease of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation of curamadol and many of its analogues and precursors.",
    "The two crises are exacerbated by the fact that these substances are available in both the legal and illegal drug markets, making them harder to detect and prevent from being abused.",
    "The use of stimulants is increasing",
    "The stimulant market is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, and both substances are on the rise in their primary markets.",
    "In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, because it is popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "About 27 million people used amphetamines that year, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for the past 20 years.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes as substitutes, so that the use of one drug rises as the use of the other falls, and sometimes both rise and fall to meet the demand of the same market.",
    "COVID-19 increases risk for injection drug users",
    "It is estimated that there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of the world's HIV infections were caused by drug injection.",
    "More than 10 million people infected with HIV and 5.5 million people infected with hepatitis C virus are injection drug users.",
    "In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug overdose, of which half died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the hepatitis C among injecting drug users remained untreated.",
    "the shortages of opioids caused by COVID @-@ 19 restrictions may lead to the substitution of more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines or the combination of opioids with synthetic drugs .",
    "as some users switch to injection or more frequent injection , there may be more harmful use patterns .",

First, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under pressure from the US. Then, according to foreign media reports, the US government is considering cutting off all links between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order to limit US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries... In the early days",
    "In recent years, the United States has never stopped its actions to suppress China's \"core\" development. On the one hand, it has precisely suppressed the supply chain of China's semiconductor production, and on the other hand, it has built a semiconductor industry chain alliance to \"go Chinese\", in order to completely \"get rid of\" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.",
    "Whether it is to establish a \"technical alliance\" with South Korea or to establish a \"four-party alliance\" of chips with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a \"small circle\" of semiconductor industry chain by means of the \"four-edge mechanism\" and \"Indo-Pacific economic framework\" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, the United States attempts to build a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States by introducing the means of politic",

    "Recently, ASML Holding, a global leader in photolithography, warned that the ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.",
    "According to the analysis of the US media, after the US government implemented the brutal suppression on the Chinese chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies suffered greatly, including the developers of electronic design automation tools, chip designers, manufacturers of wafer manufacturing equipment, and chip manufacturers themselves.",

    "Yangtze Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuo Bo) Yangtze Evening News/Zinu News Reporter found on the 10th that after more than ten years, the \"price guarantee agreement\" has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A residential complex in the Jiangbei New District claims to \"compensate the difference in price\" and offers more benefits than the previous discount for other properties before the delivery. The developer is willing to exchange the property and refund",
    "The \"price guarantee\" conditions are not few",
    "The property is called Poly International Yangzi Cui Yun Tuan, and Mr. Sun, the viewer, told the reporter that he found a \"notice\" when he was browsing the property last weekend.",
    "The developer of the project promised in the pictures sent to the reporters that if the buyers purchased the property between February 1 and February 28, the developer would exchange the property and refund the difference if the other properties in the project had a greater discount than the discount the buyers had previously enjoyed (limited to other unsold properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type as the property).",
    "Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this was actually a \"price guarantee agreement\", which was intended to make the buyer feel at ease to sell, without worrying about the developer lowering the price to promote sales, \"Now I'm afraid that it will be lowered after I buy it, and I don't have time to go to the sales office to make a fuss. If I don't make a fuss, I will really feel bad.\"",
    "However, some buyers believe that the \"price guarantee agreement\" is a \"pill to calm the nerves\" for buyers, but the conditions are not low.",
    "Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a home for her family in Jiangbei, said that the properties with price guarantee must be of the same type, in the same building, and in the same unit. There are few properties that buyers can compare prices with, so the \"barrier\" is still quite high.",
    "Some buyers believe that due to the asymmetry of information, the sellers may not exclude the possibility of giving additional concessions during the sales, and it is not easy for the buyers to \"defend their rights\".",
    "Whether the buyers can be retained remains to be seen",
    "The reporter learned from the Nanjing Online Real Estate that the sales permit of the two buildings in the project was issued in November last year, with a total of 252 units, including 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, and the average price of the fully decorated sales permit was 39843 yuan per square meter.",
    "However, two months later, the online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is 157, accounting for 62.3%. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, and 113 units are unsold. There are 44 unsold units in Building 7, and the total number of units sold is only 33, accounting for 13%.",
    "Market sources said that the \"price guarantee agreement\" had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.",
    "In August of that year, the residential building Hushitangxiyuan on Huangshan Road in Hexi District launched the \"Price Guarantee Plan\" to attract buyers. The specific content was \"the company solemnly promised that if the project's discount increased within one year, the company would refund the difference to the old owners.\"",

The number of new non-farm jobs increased by 517,000, which was significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, which was the lowest in nearly 50 years; the year-on-year growth rate of hourly wages was 4.4%, and the month-on-month growth rate was 0.",
    "From the total amount, this data is affected by many one-off and technical factors, such as the return to work of teachers and workers after the strike, the revision of the survey and statistical methods, and the update of the seasonal factors. It is likely to be revised in the future (for example, the number of new non-agricultural jobs in January 2022 was revised down from 504,000 to 364,000). The non-agricultural employment may not be as strong",
    "From the structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises still exists, but the proportion is low; the new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels and education and health care has risen sharply, and the data shows that the labor force gap in the service industry still exists.",
    "The rebound of the service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor shortage data that exceeded expectations, as well as the strong consumption credit data, we judge that the US service industry has experienced rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.",
    "We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US labor market cannot be improved without a recession.",
    "Currently, the US labor market has a supply gap of more than 5 million, while the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old has approached the peak before the epidemic.",
    "In addition, due to the strong excess savings and consumption credit of American residents, the strong consumption demand will further delay the impact of tightening policy on the employment market.",
    "The tight supply and demand in the US labor market will be the background of the US economy in 2023.",
    "With the interest rate hike nearing its end, inflation expectations are constantly fluctuating, and we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.",
    "Before the release of this data, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Fed\u2019s interest rate hike path.",
    "As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed is maintaining a fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, but the market is ignoring the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, not only expecting an early end to interest rate hikes, but also expecting two interest rate cuts by the end of the year.",
    "In the face of tight supply and demand in the labor market and the uncertain impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme expectations and crowded trading may cause some damage to the market.",
    "However, the stubborn wage growth will not change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative and the leading indicators of various CPI items gradually improving, the US CPI data has turned to the stage of rapid decline since October. The stubborn wage growth will only form a bottom for the future inflation data. The current market expectation is difficult to disprove. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of bargaining.",

    "According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there were a total of 156 domestic public fund managers, with a total fund scale of about RMB2.6 trillion; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.",

More importantly, it helps customers to collect all the information of their fund investment, so that they can better optimize their fund portfolio and better plan their financial arrangements.",
    "How to register and use?",
    "The reporter noticed that the \"Fund E Account\" APP has been available in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, Oppo, vivo and other mobile application stores, but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, and registration requires filling in the invitation code, and investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain it.",

    "What is the object that was shot down in the sky over Alaska?",
    "the situation is confusing, and there are many guesses.",
    "On Friday afternoon (February 10), the US military used its most advanced stealth fighter jet F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying in the sky over Alaska.",
    "The crash site was about 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.",
    "This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an airborne object.",
    "Last Saturday, a Chinese spy balloon that had been drifting in U.S. airspace for several days was shot down near the coast of South Carolina.",
    "The second object was first detected entering U.S. airspace on Thursday night, and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), and was about the size of a small car, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.",
    "The Pentagon also said there was no evidence that the object was maneuverable.",
    "John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said on Friday that although the specific nature of the object flying at high altitude was not clear, it \"posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft.\"",
    "Kobe said that this object was different from the spy balloon found in the United States, and it did not hang \"effective load\".",
    "Kobe said, \"We call it an 'object' is the best description we can make at the moment.\"",
    "President Biden was \"very deliberate\" in making the decision to shoot down the object after consulting with the Pentagon, Koby added.",
    "The official description of the object by the US government can be summarized as follows: the size is equivalent to a small car, there is no control stick, no hanging device, and the flight altitude is about 10,000 meters.",
    "But these information still can't answer the basic questions, such as what this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is on.",
    "At present, many analyses and guesses on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.",
    "It may be like the spy balloon that invaded the US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, which may have been sent to perform some tasks at different locations.",
    "Some people also associate this object with UFOs.",
    "The report of the US Newsweek quoted Peter Meijer, a former US congressman, who tweeted on Friday, \"I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO\".",
    "\"The irony of mixing up alien spacecraft and weather balloons is quite amusing, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict,\" Majer said.",
    "Majors tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.",
    "The weekly news said that not only Majer but also other people doubted that this object was a UFO.",

    "After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted the Amazon customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes still had inventory. I asked for an exchange. The customer service said to solve it. Then I saw the product name immediately changed to short sleeves. It turned out that the link I bought was taken down.",
    "Then the customer service told me that I could either keep the product and get a refund for a certain amount, or return the product.",
    "is this how amazon treats its employees?",
    "It's really unbelievable, the problem of clothes sent wrong is not my problem, as a consumer, I require to get the goods I should get, and I didn't make any exaggerated requirements, but Amazon changed the name and said there was no inventory.",

    "It is said to be made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in some parts, and it is unclear whether it is made of cowhide or not. In addition, the sleeves of this coat are really hard to understand. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the hem, but usually only by 1-2 cm. This coat is 5 cm longer. The sleeves of this coat cover the fingers,",
    "It's easy to buy clothes and return them.",

    "The clothes are well made, but because the size is too small, I have to return them. However, after returning them, it has been more than a week, and I still haven't received the refund?",
    "And you have to contact the seller yourself, who is not very reliable, this is the worst shopping experience I have had since I bought something from Amazon!",
    "But the store is still good. It actively cooperates with the courier to refund in time. But the work of this Sinopec Express is really done quite angry. It took about half a month to refund. This partner will drag Amazon's leg. It is inefficient in work and has no service consciousness!",

    "I just bought it and it went up by more than 200. What's going on here.",
    "I used the first Amazon cooperation, the daily rotten express, the first time I didn't receive the goods at home, and then I made an appointment with the expressman twice, but the expressman didn't send it, and then he returned the goods directly. This expressman is a scoundrel, and I strongly suggest that you don't use the daily rotten express again.",
    "This time, they also returned a T-shirt to me, and the price of the next one increased by more than RMB100.",

    "I applied for a refund, and the factory people said it was caused by transportation when they saw the picture. Isn't that just making it up?",
    "how can the inside of the product be worn out?",
    "There are only two possibilities, either it's a defective or used product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it for a refund.",
    "Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I have not damaged the goods, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's own goods, and customers choose Amazon's own goods because they trust it. customer win, we win, the victory of customers is the victory of manufacturers, and I hope everyone can work together to improve.

    "There will be a sticker on the package to prevent it from being opened. This time there is no sticker. There is a sticker like the one on the phone that can be pasted on the warranty card. This time there is no sticker.",

    "waiting for the supplier's reply",
    "The packaging has no mark, so I called the supplier directly and said that the answer is genuine if it has no mark. If you have any doubts, you can send the leftover materials to Johnson & Johnson for inspection. I also left the license plate number and phone number. I promised to send a text message to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson official website warranty card. I haven't received the text message yet?",

    "Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.",
    "I originally purchased the page size option of 7c, 8, 9c, and at the time I thought this was a trap, so I called the Chinese customer service of Rakuten, and clearly stated that 8 is 8c, but when the goods returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm, and I felt that this was a deliberate trap to cheat Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), and now when I look",
    "Chinese customer service: I'm sorry to have caused you loss. We have two options for you:",
    "1, you return the goods, the buyer bears all the shipping costs.",
    "2. If you don't return the item, we will compensate you 1000 yen.",
    "(I calculated the account, the shoes cost more than 4000 yen, which is equivalent to 200 yuan, and the choice 1 is that I don't have shoes, so the loss is 200 yuan.",
    "I chose option 2, and they compensated me 2000 yen. The loss was 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously. The next day, I received an email saying that I did not accept the mediation of Chinese customer service, and that was the end of it.",
    "I said: when I buy the page with the confusing options such as 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service told me that the Japanese common code will not have c, such as 140, but have you ever gone to other caterpillar pages to look at it?",
    "There are beautiful words, and the situation of mixing the day words and the tag words.",
    "Besides, why do you put the 8cm in the middle of 7c and 9c? It's the smallest size, so why do you put it there?",
    "Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know you want to bring it back to China, so we won't reimburse your shipping fee.",
    "I don't understand this logic. I'm Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists going to Japan don't have the time to make international long-distance calls. So the question is, who needs to make a Chinese call to Amazon overseas? It's just people like me who do dayou.",

    "i'm not very satisfied with this purchase",
    "This is the second time I bought Huggies diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of European imported paper diapers when my baby was two months old. The first purchase experience was quite satisfactory. The baby used one diaper all night long, and it could really last for 12 hours without changing the diaper.",
    "But this time when I bought the L size diapers, there were 2 packs in each box, and after opening them, I felt that the paper was loose, which was obviously different from the imported HUGGIES. After using them on my baby, they were okay, and there were no signs of urine leakage or red rashes.",
    "However, when the second package of diapers was used, the baby\u2019s inner thigh immediately developed red rash, which has not yet disappeared.",
    "I suspect that the two packages in the box are of different quality.",
    "I won't buy it again in the future!",
    "I hope that the transportation and protection of packages will be given more attention",
    "This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen in my online shopping for so long. There is no protection measures, such as cushioning foam, cushioning layer materials, etc.",
    "it's just a box that's been compressed.",
    "And it's packaged in soft plastic, the card box is pressed open and deformed.",
    "I hope it is a genuine product and of good quality. I am afraid I will not buy anything from Amazon in the future.",
    "I would rather pay more for domestic products, because they are more reliable.",
    "And the packaging of the product, I saw comments in 2016 that people have commented on, and now in 2019, it\u2019s still the same.",
    "It is said that Amazon does not care about service feedback, which is far behind JD.com and Tmall in China.",

    "It's smaller than I expected, but it's meant to be carried out of the house, so it's okay.",
    "I tried it at home last night. After pushing the bottle cap open, the distance between the straw and the cap is too close. Because the position of the straw is vertical, my son always has to suck the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this can be improved.",
    "It seems that other brands of straw cups are right to make the straw slant, children's things are really concerned about safety and comfort.",
    "lightweight and large capacity",

    "fake, fake is so fake",
    "Amazon sells fake goods, I'm really surprised.",

    "Because of trust, so sad, after all, is the face wash, really go to the physical store to buy, approved a little more expensive.",
    "Because it was a kill, so I didn't look at the comments, I have submitted the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Market Regulation, let's fight for our rights together.",
    "is it broken?",
    "fake?",
    "It's a tragedy anyway.",
    "I chose the second one with fine pores, but when I opened it, it had a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used it before. When I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it. It was a very strong smell that I couldn't describe. I immediately coughed it out and my eyes hurt and I cried. I immediately took it off and washed my face.",
    "I don't believe in superstitions and opened another one of the same kind. It doesn't have such a strong smell. I'm applying it now.",
    "It was a bit like the smell of cheap hair spray in a hair salon.",
    "It is hard to imagine that Amazon's own skin care products will be avoided from now on?",
    "you're a crooked merchant",
    "When I bought it, the activity page said that I would get the \"Three Body Full Collection\" if I spent \u00a599. When I received the goods, I didn't get the gift. I called the customer service and said that I needed to show them the screenshot of the activity. The problem is that who would save the screenshot of the webpage when they bought something? You guys did the activity yourself, and you still need the customer to help you? All buyers should be careful next time",
    "after use",
    "I bought something from Amazon for the first time. I have some feelings about it. First, I will talk about the feelings after using the product. It is really painless and there is no irritating smell. Overall, it is not bad. It will fall off after rubbing for about 8 minutes. There will be a small amount of hair debris on it. It is not noticeable unless you look carefully. So overall, it is not bad. As for whether I will continue to use it",
    "I think this thing is really good.",
    "Second, I ordered on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, which is a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service and attitude of Amazon are also good.",
    "Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. I ordered on Friday and waited for two days to get a discount of about $12, which means I paid $170 (including shipping and other fees). It feels like they are raising the price when they have a promotion.",
    "The customer service said that the price fluctuates, but I have been watching the price for more than 10 days, and the fluctuation is not big.",
    "Price is reasonable, made in Japan, with Chinese label, with particle, and absolute return!",
    "The body of the toothpaste is grainy, and the refreshing feeling is just right. After use, the teeth feel smooth. It is much better than the second-hand product. It is said to be imported products, but many products do not have Chinese labels. I don\u2019t know where they are distributed.",
    "From now on, I will never go to the second-hand market to buy anything that Amazon has.",
    "I have a suggestion. Sometimes you can't post your order on the Amazon app. I hope you can improve the application. You will do better and better!",

    "Garbage Excel doesn't care about customer needs. When you place an order, they will only deliver between 19:00-22:00.",
    "Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to lie down after surgery at home, so they can only receive the package at night.",
    "The result was that they came to the door at noon without calling in advance.",

    "Overall 2 stars.",
    "I read this book in my sophomore year of high school. At that time, I just wanted to kill time and play. I felt that I wouldn't be addicted to such books. After all, the web novels in the past were not very attractive to me.",
    "then... fell into the pit.",
    "According to this plot, the whole book is relatively light and cheerful. In the early part of the book, Ye Xiu was still in the online game. Even if there were conflicts between guilds, they were often resolved by Ye Xiu, so they were not serious.",
    "As for the part of the competition, I wrote about the slight heartache of the changes of the times and the new and old alternation (maybe I am too sentimental).",
    "It took me a lot of time to read the whole book during my sophomore year, but I just couldn\u2019t stop reading.",
    "The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Some characters are only mentioned occasionally, but they still leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters such as Ye Xiu, Huang Shao Tian and Su Mu Chen, who are described in detail, have a large number of fans. The characters such as Jiang Bo Tao and Chu Yun Xiu, who are not the focus of the writing, are also very popular. In an electronic sports novel, it is difficult to",
    "As for the romantic line, the novel doesn\u2019t have the common problem of having 3,000 concubines in most web novels, either beautiful or gay. The common point of all the characters\u2019 feelings is that they love the game Glory, and most of them want to win the game in a fair and square way.",
    "The small amount of measurement has no big conspiracy, and everyone looks so simple and cute.",
    "This might also be the reason why there are no annoying characters in Full Time.",
    "The full-time IP is big, and it's also thanks to this.",

    "I have wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I never had enough money to buy it. Then I found that the books on tb were fake. Recently, a new version of the book was released, and I liked the cover picture. However, I still decided to buy the old version. So I looked at it on Amazon and bought the whole set at once.",

The largest version is as long as 50 cm and as wide as 34 cm, which is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo; the middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and it is a two-volume set with a bookcase.",
    "I think it is acceptable. First, it is cheap and the 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which is convenient for reading. Second, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, where paintings are the main body. The black and white handwritten manuscript of Leonardo da Vinci occupies most of the space. For readers with limited budgets and who are not professional in art, this edition is the most cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.",
    "2. The explanation of the painting is great, including composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know whether it's the printing or the book size problem, some shadows are too deep, and the details are not clear, which is a pity.",
    "3. Compared with the manuscripts of Michelangelo, the manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci are much more rich.",

    "Merchants consider their customers before shipping goods. >",
    "The merchant is more responsible. He specially called to ask the size of the camera used by the customer. He really thought of the customer.",
    "The shipping speed is also fast.",
    "The gold foil patch is also suitable and effective.",
    "the battery is not fully charged",
    "The machine is really good. I wonder why it can't be fully charged when it is charged for the first time. The charging indicator light is always red.",
    "I can't find the official feedback channel of Amazon, so I can only feedback in the product review",
    "1. On March 29, I purchased this book for 31 yuan through the pre-order route, and it was shown that it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At that time, the book was not available for preview on the Amazon official website (because it had not been released);",
    "2. The book pushed to the device on March 31st is blank, only please wait for it, and the e-book version of the book on Amazon has been discounted to RMB 18;",
    "3. I tried to delete the blank books downloaded from the device and re-sync, but I still couldn\u2019t get the electronic version of the book with actual content, but I saw that Amazon\u2019s official website could preview the book.",
    "i have a few thoughts at the moment",
    "1. The price is not the most important thing. The key is how to change the blank books on Kindle to books with real content, instead of always downloading and waiting for the books to be published.",
    "2. I won't buy the books I pre-ordered in the future. After all, if the books are not delivered, I will have to download another book with empty content, which is very complicated.",
    "3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel to feedback such problems. When there are doubts about the download of e-books or the use of them, there should be a place to feedback (tickets, online customer service can be used, and you can refer to how Microsoft official store does it)",
    "I don't recommend reading it",
    "I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see it and write a reading afterthought based on my memory.",
    "This book is more like a collection of fragments of love in life than a collection of short stories.",
    "The tone of this book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the words and sentences are extremely concise, and the plot is like a street in the afternoon of summer, quiet and plain.",
    "Each short story is a snapshot of a small part of the ordinary life, without beginning or end.",
    "Finally, they were gathered together and named \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".",
    "I think this collection of short stories and its title are like performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the ups and downs on the stage, the sea and stones in urban legends, or the sweetness of you and me. Love is not represented by any of these things, nor should it be. Love is also the plain and ordinary life, the dull and repetitive days, the helplessness of life, the escape from reality, and the uncertainty of the future.<|im",
    "As you read this book, you may recall the quarrels of the couple next door, the dull marriage of someone you know, and the unhappy love affair.",
    "This is exactly why I don\u2019t recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot are both dull and uninteresting, unless your life is full of drama or you live in a candy castle, in which case you might find it interesting.",
    "And from the perspective of thought depth, the daily scenes did not make people feel surprised or expand their thoughts and vision (this is different from Marquez\u2019s Love in the Time of Cholera), and the short fragments did not discuss any problems, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?",
    "what are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?",
    "So I don't recommend reading this book. It doesn't matter whether you read it or not.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres than through plot, which is the reason why the reading experience of this book is not so good.",
    "It is suitable for a quick read, but not for a careful reading.",
    "The book is logical, but the content is not enough.",
    "It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in how to do it. It only points out the direction but does not give specific measures.",
    "Also, this book feels like it was put together haphazardly.",
    "The examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.",
    "It is not clear whether the story is made up for the purpose of example, and if the author gives some examples of his own experience, it will be more convincing.",
    "They keep changing the name of customers to clients.",
    "The title is still the customer, but the content becomes the customer.",
    "There are also problems such as spelling mistakes, missing punctuation marks and wrong numbering in the e-book.",
    "In a word, this book is a good choice for those who want to learn the theory of sales, but it is not suitable for those who are already working in sales and want to improve their sales skills.",
    "A quick guide to the internet finance",
    "This book is very shallow, and can be said to be only an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of internet finance, but to understand it deeply, you still have to follow the clues and dig it yourself.",
    "Moreover, the book was published earlier, and the content of the later WeChat payment subsidy war that cultivated user habits was not mentioned. Nowadays, the proportion of third-party payment is probably not as small as that mentioned in the book.",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat with their mobile phones. Merchants also give up using UnionPay because of the high bank flow.",
    "But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is obvious that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the financial development history of both domestic and foreign countries. Therefore, he can write such easy-to-understand contents.",
    "It is easy to write high-sounding words, but it is difficult to write them in a way that is easy to understand.",
    "i admire you, and i want you to know that!",
    "The first factor to determine a person\u2019s job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether he or she is given enough attention and appreciation in the workplace.",
    "According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after the basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is to meet the psychological needs - the need to be understood, affirmed and appreciated.",
    "Indeed, for the Chinese, most of them are \u201clove you but can\u2019t say it\u201d, even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will keep it in their hearts and never say it.",
    "The author describes five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, receiving gifts, and physical touch.",
    "I think it's not so important that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them to appreciate and thank the people around you, whether they're your family, friends or colleagues.",
    "In fact, the closer the relationship is, the more appreciation and gratitude is needed. Only in this way can our lives become more beautiful.",
    "Learn to appreciate, and enterprises can retain talents to some extent and reduce the resignation rate.",
    "Thank you for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and the world.",
    "Due to the cultural background of the East and the West, there will be some differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the original version of the author, you will gain more.",
    "once again, thank you to the author, translator, and editor for your hard work!",
    "I suspect it is a fake product, please Amazon to strictly review",
    "The quality is super bad, the packaging is loose, and it has no weight. It is even worse than the products on the street stalls. There is no weight, no barcode, and the ten-packaging is also loose. It is not the characteristics of qualified products. It is the worst shopping experience on Amazon. I have already applied for a refund. It is a quality problem. I suggest that the merchant should open his eyes and refuse to accept inferior goods. Supplement: I bought X",
    "I expect Amazon to be more careful and strict in controlling the source of goods.",
    "The product is mediocre, and it falls short of expectations.",
    "Pros:",
    "1. Big brands, cheap price.",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are still okay to use, but they are not as good as I expected.",
    "Disadvantages:",
    "1. There is no indication of charging. This is the most basic indication of power source. It is estimated that customers who purchase products worth RMB 300 are considered to be charitable by Panasonic. There is no respect.",
    "2. It has a strong odor. Even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.",
    "The office tried it for one day, and the whole room was filled with the smell of plastic.",
    "Compared with the Philips PHILIPS I used before, although it has an additional blade, the quality of this product from Panasonic is really not up to the consumer\u2019s expectations.",
    "small package",
    "I received the express and saw that it was an e-commerce version. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be M. It was not the same as the picture on the product description. It was a new version.",
    "Three stars are because I was careless and didn't look at the product specifications. I don't mind you selling the M size e-commerce version, but what does it mean that you sold the wrong version?",
    "The e-commerce is so complicated, so I\u2019d better go to the supermarket.",
    "That's it.",
    "i don't like the taste",
    "The kid doesn't like the taste of toothpaste, and always says it's spicy. Maybe it's more accurate to use another word to describe it, but the kid's vocabulary is limited to this word for now.",
    "I bought it during the event, it was very cheap, so I didn't want to give it a bad review, so I gave it four stars, but I won't buy it again.",
    "this is the real thing. it's packaged well.",
    "The packaging is very complete, and there is an inflatable bag inside. There is no product as described in the online comments.",
    "The plastic film was also wrapped around the bottle as described in the picture. The express delivery was also fast. It arrived the next day after I took the picture.",
    "It's a genuine product, but it's out of stock. I don't know when it will be back on the shelves.",
    "A frustrating shopping experience",
    "I placed an order on Black Friday, but I didn't receive it for a long time. After checking, I found that the package had been signed. I asked my colleagues, but they said they didn't sign it. I contacted the express company, but they said that only the sender could initiate the inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service, and after waiting for more than ten days, I finally found out that the express was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of negotiation, I",
    "wrong picture",
    "I thought I could get the earphones like Figure 1, but I got the earphones like Figure 2. The figures are inconsistent, but what does it mean that the left and right sounds are different?",
    "Although the names are the same, I still hope that you can be careful and pay attention to it. Also, please ask the Amazon responsible person to change the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.",
    "the operating system is just so-so",
    "It took a while, but overall the screen is okay, I can't tell the difference, but this system is hard to look at, it takes a long time to boot up, and it's hard to set up, and the software that comes with it is not worth mentioning, the response speed is just average, and it's not even in the same league as my colleague's.",
    "I read the comments and found that it was a very humanized design. I didn't find any humanized design. The location of the design of the up, down, left and right keys and the return key of the remote control is really not good.",
    "So, just use it as a TV and use a TV box or something like that.",
    "the price is too low.",
    "The price is too low, 100 plus now 99!",
    "I have accumulated a lot of unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a copy of the same sentence as the review content.",
    "If I evaluate this product with this sentence, it means that the product is at least 85 points.",
    "As for the poorer products, I will never be lazy to copy and paste the evaluation, so that other consumers can refer to it when they buy, and the merchants will also improve the quality of the products.",
    "Low price good line, not fever just this is enough!",
    "This cable is so cheap, but it should have reached the HDMI certification standard. It is a great deal compared to the domestic ones in Akihabara. The cable is thick and flexible. It can transmit 7 meters without any noise. I will buy the cheap cables from Belkin in the future!",
    "The products are good, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.",
    "After ordering, I found that I had ordered the wrong item, but I couldn't cancel the order. The online customer service on the website always showed an error link, and I couldn't contact them.",
    "When the goods arrived, the delivery man called me and said that I didn't want it and wanted to cancel the order. I didn't cancel it successfully, so the delivery man took it back and said that he would sign the receipt first and let me apply for a refund.",
    "When I applied for a refund, I was told that food items cannot be returned once they have been received. I tried to call Amazon customer service, but they said the same thing: once the item has been received, it cannot be returned.",
    "I have bought items that cannot be returned according to the policy from both JD.com and Suning, including milk and diapers, and I contacted the customer service and they returned them. Even if the diapers were opened and had a strong smell, I contacted the customer service and they returned them. However, it is not possible to return items from Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, but people are alive. How did you handle it when you contacted your customer service?",
    "He told me that I should either take it or let the deliveryman buy it himself. It\u2019s not easy for the deliveryman to make a living. Why should I ask him to pay for something that he didn\u2019t buy himself?",
    "okay, i won't back down. i'll take it, but i have to give you a 1-star rating for your service.",
    "i'm telling you not to waste your money",
    "First, I bought it with great expectations. I thought that the Dole brand should not be bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay. The size was not bad, but there was a box that was mostly soft. It was not visible from the outside. It was tasteless and had no taste. The flesh was dark yellow, which was bad. It was sold with good and bad ones. Only about one third could be eaten. I advised everyone not to buy it.",
    "I learned my lesson, I won't buy fruits from online stores again!",
    "where is the anti-counterfeit mark on the product?",
    "The corner of the bottle is sunken, which should be caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, it feels that the degree of trampling is heart-wrenching. After all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is still an international purchase. There is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark. It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that the honey inside the lid directly comes out from the inside. There is almost no adhesion.",
    "I don't understand this as a Chinese.",
    "it's probably the real thing, right?",
    "Also, when I took the picture, it said that it would arrive in the 20s, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time buying overseas, so I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is normal?",
    "The service of picking up goods needs to be improved",
    "I bought a total of 5 coupons, and when I went to pick them up, I reserved 3 at first, but only received 2, and after contacting them, they confirmed that they had forgotten to send them and promised to send them later; the second time I reserved, it happened to be a holiday, and the website and WeChat did not remind me that I needed to reserve on a working day, which caused unnecessary panic, and I suggest that they improve this in the future",
    "good shopping",
    "the goods are good!",
    "I still believe in Amazon's own products. Now that I buy overseas, it's very convenient. The logistics time from overseas is only a few days more than that in China. I must say that Amazon's ability to clear customs in China is still very strong. It is much faster than that of the transportation. Therefore, many things are bought on Amazon's overseas purchase.",
    "I hope that the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are produced domestically, but they are cheaper when bought abroad. I hope that they can be improved.",
    "trash",
    "Seeing such a package, I wonder: do you feel that it is garbage on the roadside?",
    "A plastic, fragile package, sent from Germany in a plastic bag, is this responsible?",
    "I think this packaging is like garbage. The packaging is very simple and there is no protection against damage. It is just a simple plastic bag. When I received it, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were damaged.",
    "If I just got one like this, I would accept it and buy a few like this. Then I would contact the Amazon customer service. The customer service would say that I could return it, but I would have to pay for the shipping. Then the shipping fee would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I asked, I pay for the shipping with cash, and you give me a gift card, so you want me to buy your gift card, and I have to send the product to the German warehouse myself, isn't this buying a product and suffering?",
    "I have been telling the customer service that it is the responsibility of who to have such a problem, but the customer service did not say that it is their responsibility, and they did not even dare to take the responsibility, so what guarantee is there for such after-sales service? In a word: accept it! But I estimate that my evaluation will not be given the opportunity to be published by Amazon, and it will be directly deleted!",
    "The quality is good, 5 stars, but the logistics is very poor",
    "1. The quality is good, the price is reasonable, and the value is high.",
    "2. It is solid, the material is sufficient, the welding points are firm, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is good.",
    "3. The logistics is a hard problem. The order placed on the 3rd was delivered on the 11th.",
    "4. If Amazon didn't say the estimated delivery date was February 7th, I would have been happy.",
    "5, but the expected delivery time is marked, which is equivalent to a commitment to the user. When the commitment cannot be fulfilled, the user will be very disappointed.",
    "6. If you don't have the confidence to make a promise, don't make a promise.",
    "7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by the merchants.",
    "8, so I got a low score.",
    "the gold thread will fade",
    "It still works, but whether it works well depends on the individual, or it may be a psychological effect.",
    "There is one thing that is not good, that is the golden thread. It was designed to look good, but in fact, the golden thread will fade. If you move it a few times, there will be some gold powder on your hands and on the car.",
    "I hope the product can be improved.",
    "If it's a square and doesn't have any decorative effect, don't put gold thread on it. If it falls off, it will get the car dirty and it will be troublesome.",
    "the goods are in good condition, the speed is good, and the two packages are different",
    "The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is divided into 2 parcels, and the packaging is not the same. One of them is obviously too much for shock absorption, with thick cardboard and a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging is easy to open. The other one is like a domestic express box, with a few shock absorbers, and it feels a bit sloppy.",
    "The yalan bed pad is really good",
    "The 34cm thick mattress is not ordinary, you can sleep on the mattress without the bed.",
    "The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, and the sleep is comfortable, so I fell asleep quickly.",
    "After receiving the mattress, there were two stains on it due to the violent transportation of the express. The customer service of Yalan was very responsible and efficient in contacting to solve the problem.",
    "It's not a self-made product, Amazon is shameless",
    "The page clearly states that it is self-operated, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, and the supplier is responsible for the after-sales service. If there is any problem, please contact the supplier directly.",
    "I want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier, it cannot be cancelled; I want to return or exchange the goods, I have successfully applied for return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one will care about you, you need to contact the supplier to return the goods.",
    "This is the damn self-made product.",
    "The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said \"I will contact the supplier for you\". It is claimed to be self-operated. It is too shameless. It is shameless to deceive consumers!",
    "the experience of depression",
    "The filter core purchased from another online store had a good filtering effect. After 28 days, it was still effective even if it was used for one or two more days.",
    "I have been buying things on Amazon for a long time and they are all good quality. This time I thought I would buy here. I bought a filter for the first time on Amazon. It didn't feel good. It started to have water stains early on. The filter was used for 28 days and there were floating black carbon powder. I don't know whether to continue using it or throw it away. I am very depressed.",
    "it's not as good as you think.",
    "Compared with the power strips I have used before, the external workmanship is average, and I have not opened it to see the internal structure, but I hope it is as described by the store. From the perspective of convenience of use, whether each independent unit is powered is missing a display.",
    "The package was damaged, so we will wait for the time to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer packaging is damaged quite badly, but the inner packaging box seems new. The manual is not new. It was refurbished in September. It is in stock. I hope it won't be damaged when I receive it. Please explain why several customers mentioned the damaged packaging, but you can still get it. Thank you!",
    "it's pretty good, but there are a few problems",
    "I bought a water filter for the first time. I read a few reviews and felt that LAICA had a higher price-to-performance ratio, so I chose this one. After receiving the goods, I installed the filter according to the instructions and tried it out. I felt that it was generally good, but when pouring water, the original water seemed to mix with the processed water at the spout (the seal of the original water tank was not very tight).",
    "when you use it, you must wait until all the water is filtered out before pouring it out!",
    "the picture is incomplete",
    "The picture did not show the details of the side, and the details of the side were inconsistent with the style of the subject, which was a big difference, this was the first; this bead was produced in Thailand, but the origin was not marked, this was the second; the quality was not marked, this was the third; when I bought it in the UK, each item had a box, but here there was only a simple plastic bag, and there was no product mark on the",
    "You should be careful when buying things, especially those from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is terrible",
    "I ordered two days ago, and today I received it and found that it was reduced by 40 yuan. I spent a lot of time to find the customer service, and the customer service said that it was impossible to make up the difference, and I could re-buy and return the goods.",
    "This customer experience and service is a million times worse than Taobao and JD.com.",
    "well, as a newbie, it's worth it.",
    "The condition is good, and it is not comparable to the extreme diamond. I saw the price in the market before, which is at least several hundred dollars. I am playing diamond for the first time, and it is okay.",
    "this is a good thing.",
    "The things are really good. I sent them to my girlfriend. However, I was not in Canada Post when the package was delivered. The logistics company directly put the package in the mailbox and did not send me a text message to pick up the package. I had to run two trips.",
    "but the baby is really good.",
    "worth buying",
    "The little monkey is cute, the Amazon discount is really big, the official website of Chow Chow directly sends the goods, ordered last night, received this afternoon, really fast.",
    "The postman is also very responsible.",
    "i like it!",
    "A customer's confession",
    "1. I received a defective product, and the Amazon customer service told me not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.",
    "2 Then you contact the customer service staff, they will tell you that this problem will be handled by a specialist, and he will tell you the result.",
    "You can never contact this officer, you don\u2019t know her work number, and there is no direct line to contact her, only she can contact you.",
    "It is a pity that I waited for nearly 3 days. This official contacted me. I left my mobile phone for a while and did not receive the call of this official.",
    "I waited for 2 hours and didn't get the call from the specialist. During this time, I contacted the Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service to ask her to call me back.",
    "4. It has been nearly 3 days, and I still don't know what Amazon will do about the defective coffee machine I received!",
    "5 Amazon.com in the US has no problem. Overseas shopping is a good way to shop, but it is far from the service of Amazon.com.",
    "6 i can only wait...",
    "the ground is uneven",
    "Because I saw the comments and thought it was good, so I was very excited to get it. It was very light, but when I opened it, I found a problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it is raised in the middle and sunken around the edges. The oil ran to the edges, and the big fat I specially bought to open the pot could not cover the central area. It was burned, and the pot could not be opened. I think this structure can",
    "I don't know if I was unlucky, but I got a pot with uneven bottom. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it decisively.",

    "This is a product with a very simple design.",
    "The cube shape is designed with a slight arc at the top.",
    "It should be a very smooth line.",
    "Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.",
    "Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water tank top cover.",
    "The arc of the top cover and the arc of the control panel are not consistent, and there is a height difference of about 2mm after they are assembled.",
    "although it looks like a small gap.",
    "But it can be said that the whole design feeling is destroyed.",
    "I feel sorry for that product designer.",
    "It seems that the product manager of Meituan still does not have the ability to create such a product.",
    "(Of course, I can't expect too much from the after-sales service, but when I heard the after-sales service say that all the products are like this, not just the one I bought, her indifference and seriousness made me realize that I can't expect too much from beauty)",
    "After the discount, it's very economical. Amazon's fake discount is very sad",
    "The baby was born one week ago, and the baby blanket is warm.",
    "The outside of the pot is not hot at all, so it can protect the temperature from escaping while not burning people.",
    "After a night, the air conditioner room still maintained a high temperature.",
    "Amazon said that the annual event had 320 big discounts, but later found that everyone had 249,289,299, and felt cheated for a moment, but compared with the supermarket, it was much more economical than the same price for various brands, and it could be carried in the car when going out in the future.",
    "Vitamix 6300",
    "I have been watching for a long time. I saw that the price of the Meiya 6300 was discounted. The price of the Zhongya overseas purchase is the same. I quickly made a purchase.",
    "I ordered on September 2nd, and the estimated delivery date was September 21st. However, it arrived on September 12th, which is about 10 days earlier than expected. The speed is really fast!",
    "The packaging box is not big, and it is directly used the original packaging of Vitamix. Amazon is not afraid of the damage caused by the long-distance transportation!",
    "The machine looks new and the parts are complete, but the cup is shaking violently on the base, and I'm afraid that it will fly out when it starts up!",
    "I asked 5200 friends, and they said that it doesn't seem to be as loose as mine.",
    "The random recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read. I couldn't find a Chinese version on the internet, which is a real nuisance!",
    "After receiving the goods, I bought a transformer as soon as possible. I estimate that it will take 3 days to arrive. I will have a good time when it arrives!",
    "It's too small, there's no umbrella cover, and the material is average.",
    "it's not a big deal!",
    "The second Totes, 1. This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The umbrella handle is made of average material 3. It says Large, but it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and two people would probably be too much.",

    "i don't feel good",
    "Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms when pressed. Secondly, the design of the back of the box to prevent the ABS from scratching the box surface when placed flat does not work. Thirdly, the inside of the box is just a piece of cloth, and the pull rod is more prominent. And so on, there are many dissatisfactions, and finally, the zipper is not very smooth.",
    "PS: The wheels really feel good",
    "i can still",
    "Pros: This backpack is quite elegant and looks durable.",
    "Disadvantages: the QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6 inch notebook can't be put in (can't it be a little longer), the zipper of this shoulder bag can be locked, but the buyer is not provided with a lock, which can't be called service-oriented.",
    "it's okay overall, but i'm not sure if it's real leather",
    "The overall feeling is okay, I don't know if it's real leather or not, so I can't make a blind evaluation.",
    "It can hold A4 size documents, but it can't hold too thick and hard objects (that can't be deformed).",
    "The bag is soft, and the inner bag is divided in a more humanized way, so it is still quite good.",
    "I just got this one with a small sand pit on the bottom, I wonder if it's because of my bad luck or something?",
    "I don't want to bother with exchanging it back and forth, so I'll just put up with it.",
    "I would give it four stars overall, but it's still worth it.",

    "This shoulder strap is designed more scientifically. It is practical to hang on the shoulders. The camera is fixed and protected by soft materials on the chest, unlike other fast shooters who fix the bottom of the camera with screws, which may damage the camera. It is also convenient to take the camera off.",
    "post-sale garbage",
    "I bought the piano one and a half months ago, but it is missing a part. After I notified Amazon, they gave me a phone number of after-sales service. After several communications, I still haven't received the part. What is the efficiency of this!",
    "It's more troublesome to repair after the estimate, so I hope my friends who have good after-sales service will take a detour. It's too much trouble!",
    "there are some small defects, but the tone is good.",
    "The head of the guitar has a defect, it is missing a corner, and it feels like a defective product, and there is no gift either, but this price is not bad, and the tone of the guitar is also good.",
    "well, the first face single",
    "I used it for a long time, and it was generally good except that the bass couldn't come out.",
    "It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.",
    "When I bought it for the first time, there was a problem with the product. All the lights were flashing and it was unusable.",
    "I asked for an exchange, but the goods have been in Shanghai for three days and they still haven't sent them over.",
    "I called the delivery company, but they didn't answer.",
    "The express company said that they only had that contact.",
    "Amazon can't find a place to complain.",
    "I didn't ask for it, but I got a text message saying that they would delay my delivery, which is strange.",
    "Then he talked about the problem of transit.",
    "Anyway, the poor shopping experience made me doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.",
    "I don't think I'll get it today.",
    "the label is too sticky and not waterproof",
    "Although Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not covered with film; the label is very sticky, and it is not suitable for cable labels, which is easy to fall off. Friends who buy it to organize cables should pay attention to it.",
    "The pen is fine, but the package is too simple. It is just a paper box, and there is no protection. The box for the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent adhesive. When you tear it off, the adhesive is on the box.",
    "I was very disappointed with this shopping trip. I spent 600 yuan on this item.",
    "but the pen is fine.",
    "I hope they can improve the packaging in the future!",
    "the quality is not bad, but the handwriting is not as good as 925-25",
    "First, I would like to give a thumbs up to TianTian Express. It is an air express, and it is very fast. The service attitude is also very good!",
    "I have been using 925-25 for a long time, it is very good. I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is great, and the style is also very beautiful. I gave it four stars because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and the pen cap adjusts the length of the lead a bit. My personal opinion: 925-25 is more convenient than 85.",
    "So I became a die-hard fan of Amazon.",
    "I bought it at a super low price, but my child doesn't like the pen.",
    "I opened the package and tried to apply for a refund. They actually sent someone to pick it up for free.",
    "that's so cool.",
    "We don't recommend returns, but this kind of service is unique in China.",
    "I hope it won't be abused.",

    "This earphone is really crap. I don't know if it's my ears or if this earphone is really worse than before.",
    "I bought a blue one from some easy two years ago. The sound quality is not bad, no noise, and the bass is also good. I used it for two years and it was broken. I plan to buy another one (urbeats). After all, it feels good.",
    "I saw a purple one that looked nice, so I bought it. When I opened it today, I felt something was wrong. One side was louder than the other.",
    "At first I thought it was the sound effect of the song, so I didn't think much about it. But after listening to it for a while, I found that the problem was serious. It was not only the problem of the sound being out of tune, but also the bass effect was not as good as before. There were also some noise. Is this phenomenon only in the purple one I bought? Or is the current earphone manufacturing technology really not good?",
    "It's a very poor rating. I'm very disappointed.",
    "I have to return it tomorrow.",

    "1. The front panel and the rotary knob are made of plastic.",
    "2. The rear panel audio input jack and speaker output terminal are all very poor. It is much better to find a 1000-2000 CD amplifier all-in-one machine than this model.",
    "3. The top cover is thin, and my transformer is sunken, so I have to open the box and restore it by hand. The top cover and the front panel are loose.",
    "4. The whole machine is biased to the end of the transformer, so it is very inconvenient to move.",
    "It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, with that kind of workmanship, it must be made in Malaysia.",
    "I feel that it would be better for Sony to have its products manufactured in China than to have them manufactured by Xiaomi.",
    "5. The machine is very hot. The two-channel 2-hour movie is about 40-50\u00b0C when touched with the top cover. It is not clear whether the transformer is too large and generates too much heat.",
    "Nowadays, most people turn off the power supply. This big transformer must weigh about 4kg.",

    "So I sent an email to the seller asking if he could provide the express delivery number, but he didn\u2019t reply for two days.",
    "I had no choice but to call Amazon customer service. The customer service told me the seller's phone number. I called the seller again. After several calls, the phone was finally answered. I was told that the express delivery had lost the package, and I could immediately re-send it to me.",
    "Although I was very angry, I didn't say much to the seller because the computer was urgently needed, so I just asked him to send it to me immediately.",
    "So the next day I called to ask if it had been shipped.",
    "The seller said that it hasn't been sent yet, and it will be sent in the afternoon.",
    "I called the seller again in the afternoon, and he said that he would definitely send it. He would send it after 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. However, when I called him at 7 o\u2019clock in the evening, no one answered the phone.",
    "I called again in the morning of the third day to ask if the goods had been sent out.",
    "can you tell me the order number?",

    "I can only ask the seller to send the goods as soon as possible.",

    "I bought it half a year ago and used it only a few times. Now it is contact failure. Can I ask if it can be repaired?",
    "I bought it because I have a Taiwanese machine, but I haven't used it much after buying it.",
    "I just bring it with me when I travel for work and use it a few times.",
    "Recently, I found that when I turned on the power, it would not charge. I had to hold the charger and the line connection with my hands and move them left and right a few times to charge.",

    "First of all, I just bought it a few days ago and found that it was discounted. The review is bad. The performance is good, and the CPU and graphics card are sufficient to cope with mainstream online games and a large number of large single machines.

    "The things are good, but the platform bureaucrats are still the same",
    "The hard disk is of excellent quality and has a high price-to-quality ratio. It is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I definitely recommend you to buy it.",
    "But I have to say that the Amazon platform is still bureaucratic. It has not improved since I swore to never use it a few years ago. You can never find out the actual logistics situation. The information is always sent a few weeks later. You can never complain. It's just so bureaucratic!",
    "You have received the goods for several days, but the logistics information still says that you will receive the goods in 10 days!",

    "When I received it, the seal was not in good condition, and it looked like it had been opened. I took a picture of it right away. When I tore it open, the paperboard inside was damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else. I gave it to my husband to try before the anniversary. The machine had no power. Fortunately, there was no hair in the blade. If there was, it would be difficult to return it.",
    "Whether it is easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown, as the previous evaluation said, the things sent when there is a shortage are really not reliable!",

    "The shoe size is a little bit larger, 25 feet long 10.5 wide 7.5W, the foot is a little bit loose, but I like to wear loose shoes, and the insole is just right.",
    "Secondly, the shoe quality control is really not good. One shoe sole has a crack, and the other shoe surface has various scratches and a needle hole. The adhesive strip at the connection between the shoe surface and the shoe sole is misaligned. It is obviously a case of passing off the inferior for the superior!",
    "i'm a little regretful!",
    "I bought this for 280 yuan in an activity, and this price is quite a bargain for Asics. Of course, there are even lower prices if you look at the reviews.",
    "Now let's talk about the shoes. The advantages are: the shoes are very light, running is comfortable, and they fit well, so they won't be loose.",
    "It looks very good but has obvious defects: I usually wear shoes of size 40, but this time I bought a pair of size 40.5. The front of the shoe is still about one thumb\u2019s length away from my foot, but this doesn\u2019t affect anything.",
    "This shoe is very \"narrow\", although there is still some distance in front, but it feels tight.",

    "I\u2019d like to talk about the packaging. It was wrapped in a few layers of plastic film, and there was no packaging plastic bubble paper inside. When I opened it, all the parts were just sitting in an empty box. Fortunately, the toy was of good quality and there were no broken parts. It was just too small, and because it didn\u2019t have batteries, it often went off the track. I felt that the gap between the tracks was too big, and the design was",

That means the watch is not accurate, in other words, it is a fake product. I am not saying this to be rude. Look, they are selling obvious quality problems (the numbers are not shown completely). Are they selling garbage products?",
    "I contacted the seller, who gave me a lot of excuses and blamed me for buying their products. I wonder who would dare to buy products on Amazon in the future.",
    "In short, I suggest not to buy anything from this seller. If you do, you will get a piece of junk.",
    "Amazon shipping issues",
    "Upon receiving the goods, we checked and found:",
    "1. The packaging is severely damaged.",
    "2. The table of contents is severely used and folded.",
    "3. The table lamp cannot be charged, and the time cannot be adjusted.",
    "4. Contact Amazon customer service. You can only send it to the United States by express mail and pay the postage fee later.",
    "5, the reason for 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.",
    "i can only say that it's still acceptable",
    "The time is not very accurate, it is about one second faster every day. After using it for a few months, it is already more than two minutes fast.",
    "I used to use a West Iron City watch, and I felt that it would not be a few seconds different in one or two years.",
    "The calendar function is pretty good, but the timer function is a bit useless, as it is rarely used, and I occasionally accidentally enter the timer mode.",
    "solar-powered watch",
    "Advantages: solar charging, no need to worry about battery replacement, world time, multiple alarm clocks and hourly reminders.",
    "Disadvantages: the mirror is easy to scratch and collect dust.",
    "Value for money: the price in China is generally between 220-300, and the price overseas is about 180 (it takes about 1 week to get it).",
    "i'm very satisfied with this watch.",
    "It is definitely a genuine product. I have checked it in the display cabinet. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the material is sufficient, and it is also an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It is incomparable to the so-called mechanical watches of several hundred yuan. This is a genuine product.",
    "The watch is very accurate, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. The watch comes with a jewel appraisal certificate, and the diamond on the dial is real. It is very suitable to wear it yourself, and it is also very face-saving to give it as a gift.",
    "Bentley watches are really good.",
    "Worst shopping experience ever",
    "On the evening of September 23, my wife's mobile phone was dropped, and I suddenly decided to order an 8P from Amazon Malaysia. There was stock, but it was not a self-operated store and there was no price increase (I was secretly happy). Since it was not a self-operated store, the shipping was slow, and the system showed that the latest receipt would be on September 27.",
    "My wife didn't have a mobile phone, and she was very unhappy. She called me at 6:00 am the next day to ask me to think of a way to solve the problem. Later, I checked the JD.com website and found that there was a 256G model that could be delivered on the same day. I had to order another one immediately.",
    "I just want to cancel my Amazon order.",
    "Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to receive the express in the morning. At 7 o'clock, the customer called the customer service to cancel the order. The customer service replied that the order had been cancelled and asked the customer to wait for the text message notification.",
    "Well, I just patiently waited, and when I checked my mobile phone at noon, the order was still in the status of not shipped, so I immediately contacted the customer service and asked them to cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service replied that they had already operated OK.",
    "At 3 pm, I checked my phone and found that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact the customer service again to confirm that I had called three times. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to send the goods!",
    "The customer service contacted the seller on my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system, and that he would cancel the order after he got familiar with the system.",
    "But the seller has already known it, so please don't worry about it.",
    "I checked the order display on Monday, and it had already been shipped. I was speechless.",
    "Since I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call the customer service again.",
    "The subsequent processing was simply ridiculous. I had to say a step, and then the customer service representative would perform the operation.",
    "The order is still in the status of delivery refusal, and is ready to be sent again!",
    "Will Amazon take the initiative to follow up?",
    "The company has already received the money, so it doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t follow up.",
    "I'll never prepay for big items again. This is too much trouble.",
    "it looks so beautiful",
    "I have been looking at this camera for a long time, but I didn't buy it because of some other reasons besides the price. This time, I bought it because the price was still acceptable and it was a package deal.",
    "After buying it, there were no other problems, but when connecting to the software, it couldn't connect. My router is TP, and after searching online, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours changing the settings of the router. Finally, I used 360WIFI as a medium to fix it. During this time, I called the customer service of Xiaomi, and they didn't have any solution to this problem. They just asked me to contact Amazon",
    "Another thing worth noting is that the user comments on the internet say that the minimum storage card supported by this camera is 8G, and the storage capacity smaller than this cannot be recognized. I hope everyone pays attention to this.",
    "It feels okay to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine is heated to a certain extent, and if it is always on, it feels that this degree of heating is a bit difficult to accept.",
    "In summary, this product has many shortcomings, and I hope that you will be careful when you buy it.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because this was the first thing I bought with my first love. We dated for almost 3 years, and she left me last year. I still miss her.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because it was bought with my first love, and I don't know how much it's been used, or maybe it's been thrown away!",
    "We have been together for almost 3 years, and she left me last year. I still feel heartbroken when I think of her. She was the first woman in my life, and she brought me a lifetime of shadow and heartache. I still haven\u2019t been able to get over it.",
    "When I bought this phone, I thought of two feelings at that time. I can still share the joy and sorrow with you, but now it is unbearable to recall. Maybe that is life. Some people don't want to meet in their whole life, and some things don't want to know in their whole life. What can we do?",
    "How many times I saw the Samsung mobile phone, my mind thought of her, and the pain came to fill my body. I never used a mobile phone worth more than 2,000 yuan, but I bought it for her without hesitation. No matter how good you are to a person, but one day when she changes her mind, all the promises will disappear.",
    "the best of the domestic brands",
    "Huawei is a premium Chinese brand.",
    "The low-profile CEO and the enterprise rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business atmosphere that relies on advertising to raise awareness!",
    "No enterprise with no strength can do this, nor dare to do this!",
    "That's why I chose Huawei.",
    "I bought it half a year ago, and it feels good all the time. It's very good.",
    "I didn't give it a full score because there was a time when I used its offline navigation and it failed to locate. I didn't find out the reason. Other times were fine.",
    "And it can automatically design routes after searching for the destination after online input. After leaving the wifi, it can automatically navigate offline. It is very practical. It does not need to run the flow. It can directly communicate with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation. It is very good!",
    "Sony is great",
    "Sony's low-end machine still has a strong design sense, and the price is cheap, the screen is large, and the endurance is excellent. It is very suitable for the elderly to use.",
    "even though it's been a long time, this machine still works fine.",
    "However, because my Z2 has been downgraded, so this mobile phone has also completed its mission."
