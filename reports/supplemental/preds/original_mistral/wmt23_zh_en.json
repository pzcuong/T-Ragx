The effective date of this agreement is [Effective Date].\n\nCompensation:\n\nThe Company shall pay the Consultant a fee of [Fee Amount] for the Consultant's services rendered",
    "The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market:\n\nThis passage is in Simplified Chinese, and the translation to English is as follows:\n\nThe influence of COVID-19 on the drug market.",
    "Its influence may be similar to the economic crisis in 2008.",
    "The global COVID-19 epidemic has plunged the whole world into an unprecedented crisis.",
    "In many countries, this disease has put medical service institutions under great pressure, on the verge of collapse. The restrictive measures implemented by various governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.",
    "For the drug market, the influence of this epidemic is still unclear, and it's quite difficult to predict, but there's a possibility of far-reaching impacts.",
    "Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture illicit substances, as restrictions on mobility also limit the acquisition of precursors and basic chemical products.",
    "Distributors, due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.",
    "The patterns of drug use and provision may change, potentially hindering the government's ability to respond.",
    "The transformation brought about by Covid-19 is unprecedented, but we can still draw some experiences and lessons from past crises.",
    "After the economic crisis in 2008, some addicts began to seek out cheaper synthetic materials and shifted their usage to injecting drugs.",
    "At the same time, various governments reduced budgets related to narcotics.",
    "If each government responds in the same way to the current economic downturn, preventive measures such as drug prevention and related risk behaviors, as well as drug treatment services, may be heavily affected.",
    "In addition, the priority of interception actions and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for smugglers to operate.",
    "Some countries smuggle large quantities of drugs through commercial flights, with these countries' drug trafficking activities expected to be most directly affected.",
    "A messenger carries acetaminophen, paracetamol, and other drugs to make illicit substances, which are carried in handbags or hidden in personal luggage. At times, the quantity can be quite large. Due to almost all places implementing restrictions on airline transportation, such activities to supply drugs through commercial air travel could be completely disrupted.",
    "Despite disruptions to the international postal supply chain, activities using the dark web and mail shipping may increase.",
    "From a long-term perspective, economic recession and related protective measures may disrupt the drug market.",
    "Due to the continuously rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities, impoverished and weak groups are more likely to turn to harmful ways of addiction, contract addiction diseases, and engage in illegal activities related to drugs, be it production or transportation.",
    "Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation, offering services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to expand their ranks.",
    "With the government's capability decreasing, these transformations may quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.",
    "Expansion and Complexity",
    "Market growth.",
    "The population growth portion explained the reasons for market expansion.",
    "The drug addiction phenomenon is on the rise all over the world, be it in terms of the total number or the proportion of addicts in the world population.",
    "In 2009, it was estimated that there were 2.1 billion drug addicts, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64. In contrast, in 2018, it was estimated that there were 2.69 billion drug addicts, accounting for 5.3% of this demographic.",
    "In the past twenty years, the rate of growth in drug addiction in developing countries far outpaced that of developed countries.",
    "This reflects to some extent the varying population growth rates during this period: developed countries with a 7% increase, and developing countries with a 28% increase, yet it also reflects the faster growth rate of the developing countries' young population.",
    "The proportion of teenagers and young adults is the highest among drug addicts.",
    "During the period from 2000 to 2018, the population of the developing countries in this age group grew by 16%, while the population of the developed countries in this age group decreased by 10%.",
    "Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug market.",
    "Regardless of developed or developing countries, the drug addiction situation in urban areas is more prevalent than in rural areas.",
    "The reason for the increase in drug addiction cases in general is the large-scale population flow from rural areas to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, whereas this ratio was only 34% in 1960.",
    "Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.",
    "Wealth increase is linked with an escalating addiction crisis, but the ones bearing the heaviest disease burden are the poorest people in the world. The addiction situation is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing ones.",
    "Cocaine-like drugs are particularly linked to wealthier regions of the world.",
    "Similarly, the rate of substance abuse among the affluent classes is relatively high within each country.",
    "However, the rate of conversion to substance abuse is higher among those with lower social-economic status.",
    "Data from a few countries indicates a correlation between harmful smoking patterns and low income.",
    "These patterns are not common in relatively affluent social strata.",
    "The global economic restraints caused by the crisis of the novel coronavirus pandemic are likely to aggravate the risks for vulnerable groups, including drug addicts.",
    "For instance, changes in the labor market, such as an increase in unemployment rates, have historically been related to an increase in drug addiction. However, this epidemic has already forced millions of people around the world to lose their jobs due to this disease.",
    "The Covid-19 pandemic may cause the drug market to further expand. The widespread outbreak of Covid-19 could lead more farmers to increase illicit cultivation or engage in such activities, or this could be due to the weakening control of regulatory authorities, or because more people might be forced to resort to illegal activities in economic hardship.",
    "The measures related to COVID-19 restricting air and ground transportation have led to a decrease, but sea transport may have already increased as a result. The risks of interception at sea are low, and the volume of smuggling by sea is greater than that in the air or on land.",
    "Recently, there have been reports of Kanasin goods being directly transported from South America to Europe via sea routes.",
    "Complexity enhancement.",
    "The situation of the appearance of non-regulated substances is stable, but new types of potential hazardous synthetic opioids are on the rise in the complex drug market.",
    "Besides marijuana, cocaine, and heroin from the category of plant-derived substance materials, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added. Many of these are not subject to international control. The non-medical use of drugs is rapidly increasing.",
    "A member state's domestic market approximately has 500 new active substances every year.",
    "Currently, most of them are stimulants. Secondly, there are synthetic THC receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.",
    "Although the total quantity of new-type psychotropic substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.",
    "In the number of new types of psychotropic substances determined in 2014, the proportion of novel psychoactive substances similar to ecstasy was only 2%. However, by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.",
    "In type A fragments, a new class of psychoactive substances, there are many that are similar to fentanyl. Their efficacy and risks have been proven, leading to excessive death cases in North America, and there are also occurrences in other regions, but the severity is lighter.",
    "In North America, some Fentanyl in Filton have been used for producing Heroin and other narcotics (including Cocaine and Methamphetamine), while some have been used for manufacturing counterfeit pharmaceutical Fentanyl.",
    "Some evidence suggests that Europe also has cases of injection of new type psychostimulant substances: A study on the remaining waste injectors in six European cities found that many of them were contaminated with substances capable of producing stimulating effects.",
    "The use of two new types of psychostimulant substances may gradually become established in weak groups.",
    "A single type of new-fangled mental activity substance hardly ever formed a large market.",
    "The evidence coming from Europe indicates that the synthesized THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is a serious issue among homeless people and prison inmates in the marginalized groups of society.",
    "There are 22 countries that reported using new type psychoactive substances in prisons, among which the majority identified THC as the main challenge.",
    "The control of precursor chemicals for the production of illicit drugs has been a common practice in the synthesis of precursors used for the manufacture of various illicit substances such as buprenorphine, acetylbuprenorphine, and \"nodding pills\" under international regulation.",
    "Drug dealers and drug manufacturers have been continually seeking alternative substances, not only those with less regulation, but also specialized chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation, referred to as \"designer precursors.\"",
    "Measures aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 are likely to put further pressure on manufacturers who rely on pre-industrialized products in the production of illicit substances.",
    "According to reports from Mexico, this has become a reality: In March 2020, a shortage of precursors for acetylpropanolamine, which are imported from Asia, caused the price of acetylpropanolamine in Mexico and the United States to rise.",
    "Market fluctuations by the moment.",
    "Synthetic drugs have replaced Amphetamines in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.",
    "The Armenian drug market in the Central Asian Federation of Russia underwent changes between 2008 and 2018.",
    "The Russian federal authorities have seized approximately 80% less amount of Amphetamines. At the same time, the number of people undergoing treatment due to the use of similar substances has significantly decreased.",
    "Despite the excitement of the stimulant market seemingly becoming more and more vibrant day by day.",
    "According to the evidence, Jagasic biphenylamine and various casamides, including Jagamic acid and a-Phenylpropylbenzoic acid, are commonly seen on the Russian drug market.",
    "Russian authorities reported that the number of clandestine production sites for illicit drugs has significantly increased in recent times, with a substantial rise over the past two years. The number of such sites reached 152 in 2018.",
    "The markets for Afgahan and Iraqi acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) have grown.",
    "Back in 2012, investigations into hospital, prison, and other institution personnel had already revealed the significance of Methylphenidate (Methylamine phenyl-2-carboxylate) in Iraq.",
    "Crystal methamphetamine has become another major concerning drug aside from \"fenethylamine\" and curvamahedrone.",
    "A finding from a study in 2015 further proved these discoveries, addicts stated that marijuana is harder to obtain than \"phenyl-2-propanone\" or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, Iraqi authorities discovered several clandestine production sites for acetylpropionyl, the Mass Inspection Directorate has expressed concern over large-scale imports of these chemicals being used as precursors in the production of pseudoephedrine.",
    "In Afghanistan, the production of ajmalic acid and its derivatives apparently began around 2014.",
    "Since then, the detainment amount of alkaloids such as Jasmonic acid, Propanol, and Butyraldehyde has been steadily increasing.",
    "The detainment amount in the first half of 2019 was approximately 657 tons. This represents a significant increase compared to the previous year.",
    "In other countries, large quantities of methylpentan-2-one, believed to originate from Afghanistan, have been seized. This indicates that the production quantity of that country is rapidly increasing.",
    "Policy changes and change trends.",
    "In the legal domain where non-medical use of cannabis is authorized, there is a trend of increased use of cannabis.",
    "In Canada, Uruguay, and the United States, eleven legal domains permit the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "In many legal domains, the use of cannabis has increased since its legalization, and this trend has also been observed in other domains where non-medical use of cannabis is not yet legal.",
    "In the two earliest states in the United States, Colorado and West Virginia, where adults use marijuana without medical reasons, the number of such cases has increased significantly, particularly in the past month and almost every day. Since 2012, the number has exceeded the national average.",
    "All indicators show that the use of marijuana in Uruguay has been increasing since 2011, with the use situation nearly doubling in the previous month.",
    "This indicates that the primary cause of the increase is frequent and constant use of marijuana.",
    "Canadian data in the short term also shows that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage was on the rise as well.",
    "However, in 2019, about 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources.",
    "Is the drastic decrease in global marijuana cultivation due to legalization?",
    "In 2018, the global cannabis resin seizure quantity reached the lowest level in the past 20 years. This was due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which saw a decrease of 84% over the past 10 years.",
    "Compared to other regions in the world during the same period, the arrest numbers have nearly doubled. The arrest pattern indicates that policies aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market are on the decline.",
    "The regulation of new types of psychotropic substances seems to have a restraining effect on their domestic control. However, it is still difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulation of new types of psychotropic substances within the country.",
    "Some countries that regulate differently the use of new psychoactive substances show varying popularity rates of such substances.",
    "In some countries, the use situation of new psychoactive substances has decreased after they were regulated domestically through laws.",
    "Weak groups are exposed to harm from both legal and illegal opioid markets, primarily used for pain management and palliative care, in high-income countries. The distribution of this type of opioid usage is not evenly balanced across different regions.",
    "In 2018, over 90% of all pharmaceutical products containing opioids, which are available for medical consumption, were in high-income countries.",
    "Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% are in Europe, and there are still 2% in the Atlantic Ocean area.",
    "These countries' populations account for approximately 12% of the world population.",
    "According to estimates, about 88% of the global population comes from low-income and middle-income countries, but the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids does not reach 10%.",
    "Obtaining prescription drugs like opioids involves various barriers, including legislation, culture, healthcare systems, and prescribing practices.",
    "The risk of having addictive diseases is greater for economically disadvantaged people. In 2018, approximately 35.6 million people were reported to have addictive diseases.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization can increase the risk of substance abuse disorders, and exacerbate their consequences. Research in affluent countries has proven this point. An individual's unfavorable social economic track record is not only a reflection of their situation at a certain point in time, but also related to the risk of substance abuse disorders.",
    "Drug addiction worsens social and economic disadvantages, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby reinforcing the vicious cycle of poverty. These outcomes may also be related to the disrespectful attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, ethnic minorities, immigrants, and diverse sexual orientation groups, as well as people displaced due to armed conflicts or disasters, may be disproportionately affected by opioid addiction or face issues in accessing treatment services.",
    "According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy years of life lost due to disability and premature death, the social impact of harmful smoking has become more significant in the past 10 years.",
    "Between the years 2007 and 2018, the number of additional years of life due to global adjustment of substance abuse-related mortality increased by 17%.",
    "Injection drug users commonly develop liver cancer related to untreated hepatitis B, which significantly increases their life-shortening complications by up to 40%.",
    "The relationship between drugs and violence is intricately complex and difficult to determine the causal connections between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.",
    "Global data indicates that being under the influence can be a significant factor in causing harm or death.",
    "In violent events, the effect of alcohol seems to be greater than that of drugs.",
    "Although drug addiction may lead to criminal activities, in certain circumstances, such a connection can be partially attributed to various intervening factors, such as social-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and influence from peers.",
    "The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is an established criminal structure, including large-scale organized criminal activities such as international drug trafficking, they can be carried out without resorting to violence.",
    "In the short term, the existence and degree of violence is not determined by the quantity of drug trafficking, but rather by certain changes that disrupt the power balance among organized crime groups. These changes include shifts in the scale of the black market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.",
    "Latest Trends",
    "Marijuana, a substance used for drug addiction, is the most commonly used and poses the greatest risk among opiates.",
    "Approximately 1.92 billion people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.",
    "In comparison, there were 58 million people who used opioids in 2018.",
    "The risks associated with drugs in the category of aphans are often overlooked due to their limited use by consumers.",
    "In 2017, an estimated 167,000 deaths were related to substance abuse. Sixty-six percent of these deaths were caused by these substances, and half of the 21 billion life-years lost due to disability or premature death from substance abuse were also caused by these substances.",
    "The synthesis of non-medical use of opioids has aggravated public health risks.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the crisis of cocaine epidemics is in Curdado; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have hardly any commonalities in economic, population statistical data, or general drug use patterns, but they are both making great efforts to combat the cocaine epidemic caused by easily obtainable and low production cost substances, and the Fentanyl epidemic in North America.",
    "In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a significant increase in opioid-related overdose deaths over the past 20 years.",
    "In the year 2018, among the 67,367 excess deaths recorded in the United States, about two-thirds involved fentanyl.",
    "Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.",
    "The overdose deaths caused by fentanyl are partly due to the unpredictable effects of fentanyl in the illegal drug market.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for horses used outside of medical purposes has experienced significant growth.",
    "In that region, the number of horse-shoe bends patients receiving treatment is increasing.",
    "In the year 2017, the number of captured horseshoe crabs significantly increased and reached over 125 tons as a peak.",
    "In 2018, after the enactment of a monitoring law for cattle in India, the global seizure quantity dropped to 32 tons.",
    "This situation was aggravated by the production of simple and low-cost goods, in addition, there was a lack of international oversight for horsemeat and many other similar products or their front ends.",
    "This situation worsens the risks of these substances, as they are available in both the pharmaceutical market and the black market, making it harder to discover and prevent their misuse.",
    "The use of stimulants is on the rise.",
    "The domain of stimulants is primarily driven by Canasine and Alkaloid Barbital, and the usage quantities of both substances in their main markets are on the rise.",
    "In 2018, approximately 19 million people used Coca-Cola. The beverage is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "Approximately 27 million people use butylpentylbarbiturates in the same year. Among them, alkylbarbiturates with an alkyl group consisting of a butyl and a pentyl chain are the most widely used barbiturates in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to the statistics we have, the use of xylenes (alpha, beta, and gamma) in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.",
    "In some markets, Ketalar (ketamine) and Amphetamines (Amphetamines are also known as Bachorivacetamide in some contexts) can coexist. At times, they serve as substitutes for each other. When the usage of one type of drug increases, the usage of the other type decreases, and vice versa. At other times, both drugs are simultaneously increased or decreased to meet the demands of the same market",
    "New coronavirus pneumonia increases the risk for intravenous drug users.",
    "Approximately 11.3 million people are estimated to have injected drug use in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.",
    "Over 100 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV, and there are 550 million people with hepatitis B.",
    "In 2017, approximately 58.5 million people died from drug overdoses. About half of these deaths were caused by hepatitis B-related liver diseases, and most cases of hepatitis B in injecting drug users remain untreated.",
    "The shortage of propoxyphene caused by the new coronavirus restriction measures may lead users to substitute it with alcohol or chloroform-like substances that are easier to obtain, or mix it with synthetic drugs.",
    "With some users switching to injections or more frequent injections, there may be an increase in harmful usage patterns.",

    "At the end, this little lion who had succeeded in human society, lost himself. He was no longer a complete lion, but not completely human.",
    "In the end, only the back silhouette of the little lion remained, with no idea where he had gone.",
    "Perhaps, decades later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impression of grown-up children. It might be brought up unexpectedly in their minds, possibly triggering something or inspiring them.",
    "Collection of works with high price-performance ratio.",
    "I used to be unfamiliar with TASCHEN, but recently I bought quite a few of their books for the reason that they are too compelling. Whether it's the selection of topics or the production itself, they are too powerful.",
    "This work has gone through three versions. The largest version and the one similar to the complete works of Ming Kai-hui are around 50 inches long and 34 inches wide. The medium version is approximately 36 inches long and 23 inches wide. This version, however, is the smallest and comes with two booksets in a box.",
    "In my opinion, it's still acceptable because the price is low, and with over 700 pages divided into two volumes, it's more convenient to read as a paperback; moreover, it's different from the Michelangelo Buonarroti Complete Works, where illustrations take up the majority of the space. For budget-conscious, non-art specialist readers, this version offers the best value for enjoying the artwork and manuscripts.",
    "The explanation for the drawing section is great, with elements of outline analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as the last dinner), but I'm not sure if it's for print or what size, and some shadowed areas are too deep, making it hard to see the details, which is a little disappointing.",
    "Comparing Michelangelo's manuscript, the content of Da Vinci's manuscript becomes richer.",
    "The former is already a genius, the latter involves a broad scope and great achievements, which is not sufficient to describe a genius.",
    "If you could only understand half of Da Vinci from looking at paintings before, after seeing the manuscripts, you would be left speechless in its entirety.",

    "The display showed the date from the 16th of October, but I didn't receive the result until the 21st. (Criticism: The delay was too long.)",
    "The express delivery is very slow, Amazon's purchasing process turns out to be much slower than expected!",
    "Overall, I'm satisfied.",
    "Previously, I was worried about the camera's packaging. This time, it went well, there's a battery inside, the camera code matches, and I can register it on the official website. The number of unlocks is zero, the rest can only be checked over time.",
    "The shipping speed is quite fast, I'd like to complain a little about the express delivery man here. Valuable items are left at the doorstep, he comes and goes quickly, I can't open the package and check in front of him, I'm really speechless about this.",
    "The merchant thoughtfully took care of the customers before shipping the goods. :)",
    "The merchant is more responsible, specifically asking about the screen size of the camera over the phone, indeed has considered the customers' needs.",
    "The shipping speed is fast.",
    "The gold armor plate fits quite well and functions properly when attached.",

    "On March 29th, I purchased this book for 31 yuan through a pre-order channel, showing that it would be pushed to the device on March 31st. At that time, the Amazon website could not preview the book (because it had not been published yet).",
    "The book pushed to devices on March 31st is blank in content, only with a wait and see message. However, the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been price dropped to 18 yuan (approximately 18 elements).",
    "3. I have attempted to delete the blank download files on the device for the past two days, synced again, but I still couldn't obtain the actual content e-book \"The Essence of Business\" from it. However, I see that the Amazon website can already preview this book.",
    "Currently, I have a few thoughts.",
    "The price issue is not the most important thing. The key is how to transform Kindle's blank books into ones with real content now, rather than always downloading with \"to be continued.\"",
    "After purchasing a book, one probably won't buy another one, for fear that one might miss a chance and download another book with empty content, which would be quite complicated in terms of handling.",
    "3. We hope Amazon provides a normal channel for feedback on such questions regarding e-book downloading or using, with a place for users to voice their concerns (tickets or online customer service, for example, like Microsoft Official Store does)",
    "I don't really recommend reading it.",
    "I read this a long time ago, and just now I happened to come across some notes I made after finishing it. (The passage likely refers to a book or an article.)",
    "This book is better described as a collection of love-themed fragments from life, rather than a short story anthology.",
    "The tone of this book is extremely calm and unassuming, like that of clear water. The language is simple and concise, pursuing this quality to the utmost. The plot is also quiet and calm, reminiscent of a summer afternoon street.",
    "Each short story is a clip of a mundane life's moment, with no beginning, no ending.",
    "Lastly compiled together, titled \"What Are We Discussing When We Discuss Love?\"",
    "I believe this collection of short stories, along with its title, resembles a form of performance art, as the author seems to be conveying that love is not just the tragic and joyful separations on the stage, not only the dried-up and crumbling urban legends, nor just the sticky and mirroring relationship, love is not limited to these and should not be represented as such. Love is also as simple and quiet as water, the monotonous and tast",
    "While reading this book, images of bickering couples next to you, tasteless marriages of acquaintances, and unsatisfying feelings may resurface in your mind.",
    "This is the reason I wouldn't recommend reading this book, from a critical perspective, both the writing style and the plot are bland and unappetizing, unless your life is turbulent like the stormy seas or as sweet as living in Candyland, otherwise your feeling while reading will be indifferent and boring.",
    "From a depth of thought perspective, daily situations have not made people enlightened or expanded their thoughts and horizons (this differs from Marx's \"Love in the Time of Revolution\"), and the brief segments do not delve into any issues, such as what kind of errors led to the failure of love.",
    "What were the reasons for the protagonist's marital breakdown?",
    "Therefore, I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't have much significance.",
    "The author's thoughts are more expressed through techniques and style rather than story plot, which is a reason why the reading experience of this book is less satisfying.",
    "Suitable for rough reading, not for detailed examination.",
    "The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.",
    "The explanation went into great detail about what sales theories are and why they are important, but it was quite weak when it came to how to implement them. It merely pointed out the directions without providing concrete methods.",
    "Additionally, this book seems to have been pieced together.",
    "There are both domestic and foreign ones; some are well-known businesspeople or salespersons, while others are unknown despite their existence.",
    "It's unclear if this is a story compiled specifically as an example, but including some cases that are personally experienced by the authors would make it more convincing.",
    "The title for customers or clients keeps changing.",
    "Title still refers to customers, but in the body, it changes to clients.",
    "In the electronic book, there were issues such as misplaced characters, missing punctuation marks, and numbering errors.",
    "In summary, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but it is less suitable for people who already work in sales and want to raise their sales level.",
    "Quickly Understand the Introductory Book to Internet Finance\n\nThis passage is written in Simplified Chinese. The translation in English is as follows:\n\nFor a quick understanding of the introductory book on internet finance.",
    "This book is quite shallow and can be considered as just an introductory text. It can help everyone quickly understand the overall landscape of internet finance. However, for in-depth knowledge, one still needs to refer to relevant materials and explore on their own.",
    "Despite the book being written at an earlier time, the content about Alibaba's WeChat Pay supplementing PayPal's market share, which was not yet mentioned in the book, is likely to be much smaller than what is stated in the book now.",
    "Nowadays, many people bring their phones with them when they go out to eat. Merchants have given up using UnionPay due to high bank transaction volumes.",
    "Despite this, I would still like to express my heartfelt thanks to the author for writing this introductory book. It is evident that the author has accumulated numerous years of financial observation experience, and is well-versed in the financial development history of both domestic and foreign markets, which allows for such clear and understandable content.",

    "The author expounded upon five languages of praise in this book: affirmative language, meticulous actions, servile behavior, thoughtful gifts, and physical touch.",
    "I believe it's not important that you know specifically what the five languages of praise are, but rather that you can spontaneously and sincerely express your appreciation and gratitude to the people around you, be it family members, friends, or colleagues, in these five languages.",

    "Small packaging.",
    "Upon receiving the express delivery, I saw the label \"e-commerce edition\" on the top, and I immediately knew I had fallen into a pit again. It was cheaper than buying from a supermarket. The product image packaging on the introduction page seemed to be different, so it must be the new version.",

    "During the Black Five period, I submitted a parcel, but I waited for a long time without receiving it. I later inquired and found out that the package had already been signed for, but my colleagues all denied helping with the signing. I quickly contacted the post company, but they said that I could only inquire about the parcel after sending it. I contacted Amazon customer service, and waited for more than ten days, finally finding out that the parcel had been mistakenly delivered",

After receiving it, I found the packaging to be satisfactory, but the individual pieces were not impressive. However, one box was mostly soft, and the texture was not noticeable from the outside.

    "I still prefer to trust Amazon's self-operated goods. Buying overseas now is quite convenient, and the logistics time from abroad to home is only a few more days compared to domestic. I must say Amazon's customs clearance ability for overseas purchases to domestic is quite strong, faster than transshipment, so many things are now being bought overseas.",

Upon receiving it, the packaging was completely deformed, and the items inside were damaged as well.",

Later, the shipping fees were returned to me in the form of a gift card.",

The customer service, however, didn't say a word about it being theirs, not even a half sentence, let alone taking responsibility. What kind of after-sales service is there left for this? In short: Shame on them! But I estimate that Amazon will not give me a chance to publish this review, they will just delete it directly!",

However, I felt uneasy about it, not only did it start to have water stains early on, but the filter also lasted only until the 28th day, and there were suspended small black carbon particles in it. I don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. I'm really disappointed~",

    "There is no reply or rebuttal, as well as no test reports!",

    "Let me repeat what I said about the packaging. It refers to a few layers of protective films, but there's no plastic bubble wrap inside, and when you open it, all the parts are just sitting in an empty, hollow box. Fortunately, the toy quality is not bad, there are no damaged parts, but there are more pieces than expected because it doesn't come with batteries.

Since there is, why does the time difference between them being so significant? That's definitely a problem with the watches' accuracy. In simple terms, it's a problem of quality, not a difficult one to understand. Defective products with incomplete number display are being sold, isn't that garbage merchandise?",
    "I contacted the seller, and the seller gave a lot of reasons, even complaining that they shouldn't have sold them such products, this kind of seller, this kind of after-sales service. Nobody will dare to buy anything on Amazon again.",

However, since it was not self-delivered, the shipping time was longer, and the system showed that the latest estimated delivery date was September 27th.",

    "New purchase made, I immediately thought about cancelling the order on Amazon.",
    "Due to the order being placed at midnight, it wasn't possible for the express delivery to be picked up in the morning, so at around 7am, I called customer service to cancel the order. The customer service replied that the order had already been canceled and to wait for a text message notification.",
    "I see, I'll be patient and wait. When I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the status of not shipped yet. I immediately contacted customer service to ask for cancelling the order, and the customer service replied that they had already operated it OK.",

    "After purchasing it, there weren't any major issues, but I had trouble connecting the software every time. I have a TP-Link router at home, and after searching online, I found that many people had the same problem. I spent over two hours trying different router settings, but nothing worked. I used 360WIFI as a mediator to finally get it working. I contacted Xiaomi customer service about this issue, but they didn't have a solution and",
    "Another point worth noting is that users have commented online that the minimum storage capacity for this camera's memory card is 8G, and it cannot identify cards with smaller storage capacities. Please take note of this.",
    "The feel is still usable, the screen is still acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor. The machine generates some heat, and if it's left on for a long time, the heat level becomes hard to tolerate.",

    "This is the reason I chose Huawei.",
    "I have used it for more than half a year, and I feel it's been great the whole time, very satisfactory.",
    "The reason I didn't give a full score is because once, when I was using its offline navigation, there was a positioning issue that I couldn't figure out the cause for, but it worked well in other situations.",
