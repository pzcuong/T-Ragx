The corresponding freestanding environment does not have the standard libraries, and the program entry is not necessarily main, which is the most",
    "For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', treat them as C style - i.e., do not specify the number or type of parameters. (For C++ only.)",

    "The changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented, but we can still learn from the lessons of past crises.",
    "After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injecting drugs.",
    "At the same time, governments have cut their drug-related budgets.",
    "If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, prevention measures and interventions, such as drug prevention and related risk behaviors, and detoxification and rehabilitation services, may be severely affected.",
    "In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.",
    "Countries with a high volume of drug smuggling through commercial flights are expected to be the most directly affected by the drug trafficking activities.",
    "Messengers are carrying large quantities of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their hand luggage or in their personal baggage. As restrictions on air travel have been imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely disrupted.",
    "Although the international postal supply chain is also disrupted, the activities of using the dark web and parcel post to carry out trafficking may increase.",
    "In the long run, the economic recession and the related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.",
    "With rising unemployment and a lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, develop drug addiction and turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether production or trafficking.",

    "In the past two decades, the growth of drug use in developing countries has been much faster than in developed countries.",
    "This reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of young populations in developing countries.",
    "Adolescents and young adults are the largest group of drug users.",
    "Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group grew by 16% in developing countries, while it fell by 10% in developed countries.",
    "1 Urbanization is a driving factor of the current and future drug markets.",
    "In both developed and developing countries, the prevalence of drug abuse is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.",
    "Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the massive shift of people from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, up from 34% in 1960.",
    "Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, particularly in developing countries where urbanization is more pronounced.",
    "The increase in wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the poorest people in the world bear the greatest burden of disease, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.",
    "Drugs like cocaine are more firmly linked to the world's wealthier regions.",
    "Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthy.",
    "However, the rate of conversion to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socioeconomic status.",
    "Data from a few countries suggest that a harmful pattern of drug use is associated with disease and low income.",
    "These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social classes.",
    "The economic constraints of the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to increased drug use, and the pandemic has already forced millions of people worldwide out of work.",
    "COVID-19 could lead to further expansion of drug markets The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by national authorities or because of the need to resort to illicit activities in times of economic crisis.",
    "The related restrictions on COVID-19 have led to a decrease in air and land transportation, and maritime transportation may have increased as a result, with a low risk of interception at sea and a larger number of shipments than air or land smuggling.",
    "Recently, there have been reports that cocaine is being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.",
    "Complexity enhancement",
    "The situation of non-international controlled substances is stable, but new types of opioids with potential harm are increasing, and the drug market is becoming more complex.",
    "In addition to plant substances such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.",
    "There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic market of member countries every year.",
    "Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoids and a small amount of opioids.",
    "Although the total amount of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "Among the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, the number of new psychoactive substances of the opioid type accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.",
    "Many of the new psychoactive substances in the opioid family are similar to fentanyl, and their effects and dangers have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America, and to a lesser extent in other regions.",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and is also used to make counterfeit prescription painkillers.",
    "There is evidence that new psychoactive substances are also being injected in Europe: a study of waste from six European cities found that many of the syringes contained new psychoactive substances that produced a high.",
    "2 The use of new psychoactive substances may be firmly entrenched in vulnerable groups",
    "Single-substance novel psychoactive substances have rarely formed large markets.",
    "But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.",
    "Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries confirming synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.",
    "Controls on precursor chemicals have forced drug makers to innovate. Many chemicals used to make drugs such as methamphetamine, methcathinone and ecstasy have been placed under international controls.",
    "Drug dealers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives, not only substances with less regulation, but also chemicals designed to evade regulation, known as \"tailor-made precursors.\"",
    "Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.",
    "Evidence from Mexico suggests this has become a reality: In March 2020, a shortage of methylphenidate precursors imported from East Asia reportedly led to a rise in methylphenidate prices in Mexico and the United States.",
    "The market is constantly changing.",
    "Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation",
    "The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appeared to have changed between 2008 and 2018.",
    "The number of seized opioids in the Russian Federation decreased by about 80%, and the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use disorder decreased significantly.",
    "But the market for stimulants seems to be growing.",
    "There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methylphenidate and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.",
    "Russian authorities reported that the number of secret manufacturing sites for various illicit drugs seized recently has risen sharply, more than doubled in two years, increasing to 152 manufacturing sites in 2018.",
    "Afghanistan and Iraq methamphetamine markets grow",
    "As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison and other institutional staff had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.",
    "Crystal methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to \"fenethylline\" and qumamid.",
    "A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users saying marijuana was harder to get than \"Percocet\" or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered multiple methamphetamine processing sites, and the International Narcotics Control Board has expressed concern about the large import of pseudoephedrine, which is used as a precursor in the processing of methamphetamine.",
    "In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture seems to have started in 2014.",
    "Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.",
    "However, the seizure volume in the first half of 2019 was 657 kg, which was a significant increase compared with the previous year.",
    "Large quantities of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.",
    "Policy changes and trends of change",
    "Most of the jurisdictions that legalized marijuana for non-medical use have seen an increase in marijuana use.",
    "Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the production of marijuana products for non-medical use.",
    "In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.",
    "In Colorado and Washington, the two states that first legalized marijuana, adult use of the drug has increased, particularly in the past month and among those who use it daily or nearly daily, surpassing national averages since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that since 2011, Uruguay's marijuana use has increased, and the use in the past month has almost doubled.",
    "This suggests that the main reason for the increase is regular and frequent use of cannabis.",
    "Short-term data in Canada also show that the use of cannabis has been increasing as the legal market expands from 2018 to 2019.",
    "However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.",
    "Is the reason behind the global drop in the seizure of marijuana herb the legalization of marijuana?",
    "In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in two decades, as seizures in North America fell by 84% over the past decade.",
    "In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world nearly doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at loosening the marijuana market have played a key role in the decline.",
    "The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a restraining effect, and the effect of regulation of new psychoactive substances in China is still difficult to evaluate.",
    "Some countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of new psychoactive substance use.",
    "In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation.",
    "Vulnerable populations face harm from both the legal and illegal drug markets, and opioids used for pain management and palliative care are not evenly distributed across regions.",
    "In 2018, more than 90% of all opioids available for medical use were consumed in high-income countries.",
    "Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.",
    "The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.",
    "It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of the pharmaceutical opioids.",
    "Obstacles to obtaining opioids include legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.",
    "People who are poorer are more likely to develop addiction. In 2018, about 35.6 million people suffered from addiction.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of and exacerbate the consequences of drug use. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individual socioeconomic trajectories have been found to be associated with the risk of drug use, not just at a particular point in time.",
    "Drug use also deepens social and economic disadvantage, increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, minorities and immigrants, sexual and gender diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people living in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or face barriers to accessing treatment services.",
    "According to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a measure of healthy life lost to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has had a wider social impact over the past decade.",
    "From 2007 to 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to drug use increased by 17%.",
    "The increase in life expectancy years with disability adjusted for the common untreated hepatocellular carcinoma in injecting drug users with hepatitis C is particularly high - up to 40%.",
    "The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.",
    "Limited data from around the world suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.",
    "But in violent incidents, alcohol's role seems to be greater than drugs.",
    "While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be partially attributed to a variety of intermediate factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage, and other types of adversity, such as individual risk factors, family environment, and peer influences.",
    "The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, may be carried out without violence.",
    "In the short term, the existence and level of violence is more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between trafficking groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group and strengthen another.",
    "Latest trends",
    "Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most dangerous",
    "It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.",
    "By comparison, there were 58 million opioid users in 2018.",
    "But the related hazards of opioids have been ignored due to the small number of users.",
    "Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the estimated 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death attributable to drug use were caused by these substances.",
    "Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, ketamine is exacerbating the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl. The two regions have almost nothing in common in terms of economic, demographic or general drug use patterns, but they are both struggling with opioid crises fueled by readily available and cheaply produced substances.",
    "In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.",
    "In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths in the United States involved fentanyl.",
    "Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.",
    "Part of the reason that fentanyl causes overdose deaths is that fentanyl is unpredictable in the illicit drug market.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of khat has grown significantly.",
    "In the region, more and more patients with the disease are receiving treatment with Qumado.",
    "In 2017, the global seizure of rhino horns increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "However, in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate the production of ketamine, the global seizure volume fell to 32 tons.",
    "The crisis in both places was fueled by the manufacture of simple and inexpensive products, and the lack of international regulation of ketamine and many other opioids and their precursors.",
    "The crisis in both places is worsened by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and the black markets, making it harder to detect and prevent their abuse.",
    "Use of stimulants continues to rise",
    "The cocaine and methamphetamine markets are the largest for stimulants, and use of both is increasing in their primary markets.",
    "About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "There are an estimated 27 million people who use amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for 20 years.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist and sometimes substitute each other, so that the use of one drug increases while the use of the other decreases, or both increase and decrease to meet the demand of the same market.",
    "COVID-19 increases the risk of injecting drug use",
    "It is estimated that there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of the global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.",
    "More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million people have hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, about 585,000 people died of drug overdose, half of whom died of liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the injecting drug users with hepatitis C have not been treated.",
    "The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.",
    "As some users switch to injection or more frequent injections, more harmful use patterns may emerge.",

    "Confused and full of guesses.",
    "The US military again used the most advanced stealth fighter jet F-22 in the afternoon of Friday (February 10) to shoot down an unidentified object flying in the sky of Alaska, USA.",
    "The location of the shootdown was about 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.",
    "This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an airborne object.",
    "A Chinese spy balloon was shot down off the coast of South Carolina in the United States after drifting in U.S. airspace for several days.",
    "The Pentagon said the second object, which entered U.S. airspace over northern Alaska on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) and was about the size of a small car, much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon shot down.",
    "The Pentagon also believes that there is no evidence that the object is maneuverable.",
    "John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator of the National Security Council of the White House, said on Friday that although the specific appearance of the object flying in the sky was not clear, it \"posed a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aircraft.\"",
    "Kobe said that the object was different from the spy balloon found in the United States, and it did not have a \"payload\" hanging from it.",
    "\"We call it a 'body' because that's the best description we have at the moment,\" said Kobe.",
    "President Biden listened to the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the shooting down of the object, and he made the decision \"with extreme caution,\" Cooke added.",
    "The official description of the object by the United States can be roughly summarized as: the size is about that of a small car, it has no steering wheel and no suspension device, and the altitude of flight is about 10,000 meters.",
    "But this information does not answer the basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.",
    "Many online analyses and speculations suggest that it may be another Chinese balloon.",
    "It may be from China, like the spy balloon that invaded the US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, performing some tasks in different places.",
    "Some people also linked this \"object\" in Alaska with \"UFO\" (Unidentified Flying Object).",
    "A report by the U.S. Newsweek quoted a tweet posted by former U.S. Congressman Peter Meijer on Friday, saying, \"I really hope that this 'unidentified flying object' is a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO.\"",
    "\"It is surprising that the satellites and balloons are being mixed up, but it is not worth triggering an interstellar conflict,\" said Maj.",

    "I contacted Amazon customer service immediately after receiving the clothes, and at that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, and the customer service said they would solve it, and then I immediately saw that the name of the product had been changed to short-sleeved, and it turned out that I had bought a link that had been taken down.",
    "Then the customer service informed me to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount or return the goods.",
    "Is this Amazon's handling method?",
    "It's really unbelievable, the clothes themselves are not my problem, as a consumer I demand to get the products I deserve, and I didn't make any outrageous demands, but Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.",

    "Sleeves that are incomprehensible to people.",

    "And to have to contact the dishonest FedEx guy was the worst part of buying from Amazon ever!",
    "But the store is still good, they actively cooperate and urge the express delivery to return the money in time, but the express delivery really works so angry, it took about half a month to return the money, this partner is trying to pull Amazon\u2019s leg, the efficiency is bad, and there is no service awareness!",

    "I just bought it and it has already risen by more than 200, what\u2019s going on?",
    "The first time Amazon used the cooperative company, Daily Deal, and the first delivery was not at home. Later, the courier proactively arranged two times for delivery, but the courier still did not deliver. Later, they directly refunded the order, and this damn courier had no integrity at all. I strongly recommend not to use Daily Deal again.",

    "There are only two possibilities: either it is a counterfeit or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.",
    "Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I didn\u2019t damage the goods, but based on my Amazon shopping credit record, I think such goods shouldn\u2019t appear in Amazon\u2019s self-owned goods, customers choose Amazon\u2019s self-owned goods is to trust, customer win, we win, customer\u2019s victory is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone can work together to improve, thank you.",

I called the Chinese customer service of JD.com and clearly told them that 8 was 8c, but when the goods arrived in China, I found that there was only 8cm, and I felt that it was a trap deliberately set up to cheat Chinese people (according to the after-sales service of Amazon",

    "I suggested that when the purchase page was 7c, 8, and 9c, which was a confusing option, the Chinese customer service told me that the Japanese code would not have c, like 140, but did you go to other mite pages to see?",
    "There are also cases where there are both Mei and Ji codes.",
    "Moreover, why did you put the 8cm in between the 7c and 9c, which is the smallest size, what\u2019s the point of putting it there.",
    "Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don\u2019t know if you want to return to your country, so we won\u2019t compensate for your shipping fee.",
    "I don\u2019t understand this logic. I am Japanese and I need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don\u2019t need Chinese customer service. Tourists visiting Japan don\u2019t need to call international long distance. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas Chinese phone? It\u2019s just like me, who is shopping on Amazon Japan.",

    "I was not very satisfied with this purchase.",
    "This is the second time I bought Pampers from Amazon, and I bought a box when my baby was 2 months old. I chose the Pampers with imported paper from Europe. I was still satisfied with the first purchase. My baby used one diaper all night, and it really can meet the need of 12 hours without changing diapers.",
    "But this time, when I bought L-brand diapers, there were two packages in a box, and when I opened it, I found that the paper was more loose than the imported Pampers, and there was a clear difference between the two. After using it for my baby, it was still okay, and there was no urine leakage or rashes.",
    "However, when the second package of diapers was used, the baby's inner thighs immediately broke out in hives, and the hives have not faded away to this day.",
    "I doubt that the quality of the two bags in one box is the same.",
    "I probably won\u2019t buy it again in the future!",
    "Hope for transportation protection of the parcel",
    "This is the worst packaging and shipping I have ever seen after so many years of online shopping. There is absolutely no protection, no buffer foam, no buffer material in the package.",
    "It is a box in a transformational form.",
    "And the soft plastic box packaging was crushed and deformed.",
    "I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed. I won\u2019t dare to buy anything from Amazon in the future.",
    "I would rather pay 50% more and have a guarantee.",
    "And the problem of packaging of commodity products, I saw that people had commented on it in 2016, and it is still the same as before now, 19 years later.",
    "This means that Amazon doesn\u2019t care about service feedback at all, and it is far different from domestic JD and Tmall.",
    "Beautiful, but a little regrettable.",
    "I really like the color of the whole cup, which is orange red. Although I have a boy at home, I still think that orange red and yellow are eye-catching.",
    "It is smaller than I imagined, but it is still acceptable because it is meant to be taken out of the house.",
    "I tried it at home last night. The distance between the straw and the cap is too close after opening the cap. Because the straw is vertical, my son always has to hold the bump on the cap when drinking, and he thinks this part can be improved.",
    "It seems that the straw cups of other brands are tilted, which is reasonable. For children\u2019s products, safety and comfort are really important.",
    "Easy to carry and with large capacity",
    "I like it because it is lightweight and has a large opening, but I think the two independent zippered pockets are a bit excessive and I don\u2019t know what to put in them.",
    "After I bought it, I found that there was another one that was very similar in style from a different brand, and it was only about two hundred yuan.",
    "Fake goods are particularly terrible.",
    "Amazon sells fake goods, and I was fooled.",
    "The customer service said that I couldn\u2019t return it because I had used it, and I didn\u2019t know it was fake.",
    "It is sad because of trust, after all, it is a makeup product, so please buy it from a physical store and pay a little more.",
    "Because it was a flash sale, I didn\u2019t read the reviews, and I have already submitted the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Market Regulation. Let\u2019s fight for our rights together.",
    "Is it broken?",
    "Fake goods?",
    "In short, a tragedy.",
    "I chose a fine pored one for the second one, but it smelled weird when I opened it, so I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. And when I put it on my face, I couldn\u2019t stand it at all, it was so strong that I couldn\u2019t describe it, and I coughed and sneezed immediately after applying it, my eyes were also painful and I was crying, so I took it off and",

    "You traitors!",
    "At that time, the activity page said that the full set of Three-Body Problem would be given for 99 yuan, but there was no such gift when the package was received. When I called the customer service, they said they needed to see the screenshot of the activity at that time. The problem is that whoever bought the product would have to provide the screenshot of the website. You need the customers to provide the evidence for your own activity. Please be careful next time, and",
    "Feeling after using it",
    "This is the first time I bought something on Amazon, and I feel different things. Let me talk about the experience of using the product. The first one is really painless, and there is no stimulating taste. Overall, it is not bad. It fell off after waiting for about 8 minutes, and there were only a few hairs on it. If you don\u2019t look closely, you won\u2019t notice it. So overall, it is not bad. As for the",
    "Anyway, I think this thing is really good.",
    "The second order was placed on the 27th and the package was received on the 12th, which means it took a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery person from Amazon was also very nice.",
    "Third, don\u2019t believe in Amazon\u2019s Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday and it was cheaper by nearly 12 dollars after two days. I bought it for more than 170 (including shipping fee), and it feels like they raise the price when they have promotions.",
    "The customer service said that the price fluctuated, but I paid attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price was like this, and it didn\u2019t fluctuate much.",
    "Cheap, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with granules, and with a guarantee of return!",
    "The toothpaste with abrasive particles is refreshing and makes your teeth smooth; the price is much cheaper than some other brands; it says it\u2019s imported, but many products don\u2019t have Chinese labels, so I don\u2019t know where they are sourced from.",
    "From now on, I will never buy second-hand goods from Amazon again.",

    "Since there are elderly people who are not comfortable with lying on the bed after surgery, the delivery service is only available at night.",
    "The result was delivered directly to my doorstep at 12 noon, without any prior notice.",
    "If the delivery time is at your courier\u2019s discretion, why do you have to pretend to have a schedule for customers to choose from?",

    "As a title of \"Ancient Map Collection,\" the book is really unacceptable in terms of the selection of pictures, layout, and printing, and some pictures are even smudged and blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.",
    "Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small picture of an illustration, it should be worthy of the Middle Chinese literature data left by ancestors in the table of contents!",

    "Then... he fell into the hole.",
    "In terms of the plot, the whole book is relatively light and pleasant. When Ye Xiu was still in the game, even if the guilds were fighting against each other, it was not heavy at all because they were often killed by Ye Xiu\u2019s dog blood.",

    "The full-time depiction of characters and emotional lines is amazing, and some characters only appear occasionally, but they will leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters Ye Xiu, Shuai Tang, Meng Li, and Chu Yu all have a large number of fans, and the characters who are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Bo, Tuo Chi, and Xiao Hua, are also very popular. In a funny novel",
    "In terms of love, there is no problem of having three thousand beauties in the harem or the problem of having a beautiful girl who is rotten, which is the fault of general web novels; everyone in the text has one thing in common, which is that they like the game Honor and most of them want to win in a fair way.",
    "There are no grand conspiracies, just small ones, and everyone seems so simple and cute.",
    "This is perhaps why there aren\u2019t any unlikable characters in Full Time.",
    "The full-time IP is very great, and I also owe it to him.",

I like the cover of the new version, but I still want to buy the old version first. So I bought a set on Amazon.",

    "I read it three times before I could finish the book to the little kid, a little lion that could shoot and loved to eat fruit juice and jelly.",

    "I think it is still acceptable. Firstly, it is cheap and has more than 700 pages divided into two volumes, which is more convenient to read as a softcover; secondly, it is different from the complete works of Michelangelo, which is mainly composed of paintings, and the black and white manuscripts of Da Vinci occupy most of the pages. For readers with limited budget and who are not professional artists, this version is the best value for money for",
    "2. The explanation of the painting part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don\u2019t know if it is a printing or book size problem, some parts of the shadows in the county are too deep, and it is hard to see the details, which is a little regrettable.",
    "Compared with Michelangelo\u2019s manuscript, the manuscript of Da Vinci is much more rich in content.",
    "The former is already a genius, and the latter is so broad and high that it is not enough to be called a genius.",

    "Other.",
    "Logistics is too slow.",
    "Displayed on October 16, but the result was received on October 21, and the result was bad!",
    "The delivery is so bad, and Amazon is already slow when you buy things, and I didn\u2019t expect it to be so slow!",
    "Overall satisfaction",
    "I was worried about the packaging of the camera at first, but this time it was fine, and there was an inflatable bag inside. The camera was consistent with the three numbers, and I could also register it on the official website. The shutter speed was 0, and the rest could only be tested with time.",
    "The delivery speed is pretty fast, and here I want to complain about the delivery guy, who put the expensive items in the porch, and he walked away so fast that I couldn\u2019t open the package in front of him, which is really speechless.",
    "The seller thought about the customer before shipping:)",
    "The seller is more responsible. He specially called to ask about the screen size of the camera, which is really thoughtful.",
    "The delivery speed is also fast.",
    "The gold leaf is quite suitable and practical to be pasted on.",
    "Battery is not fully charged.",
    "The machine is really good, I want to ask how come the first time I charged it, it didn\u2019t charge to the full? The charging indicator light is always red.",
    "Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so you can only give feedback in the product reviews.",
    "1. On March 29, the book was purchased for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, and it was shown that it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the Amazon website (because it had not been released);",
    "On March 31, the book pushed to the device was blank, with only a request for patience, and the electronic version of the book was reduced to 18 yuan on Amazon;",
    "I have tried to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and resync it for two days, but I still can\u2019t get the electronic version of \u201cThe Nature of Business\u201d with actual content, but I can preview the book on the Amazon website.",
    "I have a few thoughts at the moment.",
    "1. The problem of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books with real content now, rather than \u201cplease wait\u201d forever.",
    "2. I won\u2019t buy the book again after pre-ordering, because if I jump the queue, it will be very complicated to download a book with empty content;",
    "3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel for feedback on such problems, and there should be a place to feedback when downloading e-books or using them (work order, online customer service, etc. can be referred to how Microsoft official store does it)",
    "Not really recommended to read.",
    "I read it a long time ago, and I just saw it in my memory.",
    "This book is not a collection of short stories, but a collection of fragments of life about love.",
    "The writing style of this book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the choice of words and sentences is the extreme of simplicity; the plot is as quiet and plain as a street in the afternoon of a summer day.",
    "Each of the short stories is a reflection of a small period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.",
    "They were collected and released as a compilation album titled When We Talk About Love.",
    "I think this collection of novels, and its title, is a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the ups and downs on the stage, not just the urban legend of the hard and dry rocks, and not just the sticky and glue-like you and me, love is not just represented by the above, love is also the mundane life, the dull and boring day after day, and also the indifference to life",
    "As you read this book, you may recall the quarreling couples around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and the unsatisfactory relationships.",
    "This is the reason why I do not recommend reading it. From the aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of the book are tasteless, unless your life is turbulent or sweet like living in a candy castle, otherwise you will feel that it is strange but not strange and boring when you read it.",
    "And in terms of depth of thought, the daily routine is not eye-catching or expands one's thoughts and vision (this is different from Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the short fragments do not explore any problems, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?",
    "What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?",
    "So I don\u2019t recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn\u2019t matter much.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and forms than through the story plot, which is also the reason why the reading experience of this book is not good.",
    "It is suitable for quick reading and cannot be scrutinized.",
    "The book is well-logical, but the content is not rich enough.",
    "It explained what sales theory is and why, but it was weak in how to do it; it only pointed out the direction but did not give specific practices.",
    "In addition, the book feels like it was assembled.",
    "For example, there are both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and those who are not well-known.",
    "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a story compiled for the sake of example, and if some cases experienced by the author would be more convincing.",
    "The term for customers has been changed back and forth.",
    "The title is still customer, but in the main text, it has been changed to customer.",
    "The e-book also had problems with misspellings, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering.",
    "In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to the theory, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.",
    "A Quick Guide to Internet Finance",
    "This book is shallow and can be said to be just an introduction, which can help people quickly understand the overall situation of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still need to follow the map and dig it out by yourself.",
    "And the book was written earlier, while the later content of WeChat Pay and Alipay\u2019s subsidy war to cultivate user habits hasn\u2019t been mentioned yet, and the proportion of the third-party payment now is probably not as small as the book said.",
    "Now many people take their mobile phones with them when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank transaction volume.",
    "But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introduction book. It is obvious that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, which is why the content is so easy to understand.",
    "It is easy to write high and mighty, but it is difficult to write simple and easy to understand.",
    "I appreciate you, and I want you to know!",
    "The first factor that determines a person\u2019s job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated in their work.",
    "According to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs theory, after the basic survival needs of human beings are satisfied, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs\u2014the hope of being understood, affirmed, and recognized.",
    "Indeed, for the Chinese people, most of them are \u201cI love you but I can\u2019t say it\u201d, even if they have love, gratitude and praise, they will keep it in their hearts and won\u2019t say it out loud.",
    "In the book, the author explains five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, tangible gestures, and physical touch.",
    "I think it\u2019s not important to know what the five languages of appreciation are, but to be able to use them from the bottom of your heart to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether they are family members, friends or colleagues.",
    "In fact, the more intimate the relationship, the more praise and gratitude are needed, so that our lives can become more beautiful.",
    "By learning how to give praise, companies can retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the rate of resignation.",
    "Thank you to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and the world.",
    "Due to the differences between Western and Eastern cultures, there are some differences between the two languages. If you have the opportunity, you can read the original version of the author, which will bring you more benefits.",
    "Thanks again to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!",
    "Suspected to be counterfeit products, please review strictly by Amazon.",
    "The quality is terrible, the packaging is loose, it has no weight, and it is even worse than the products on the roadside stall; it has no net weight and no bar code, and the packaging of ten bags is loose and loose, which is completely not the feature of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that the merchant wake up and",
    "Once again, we hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strict with the source of the products.",
    "The product is sloppy and falls short of expectations.",
    "Advantages:",
    "1. Big brand, cheap price.",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is OK to use, but it falls short of my expectations.",
    "Disadvantages:",
    "1. There is no indicator light for charging, which is the most basic thing for indicating your power, and I guess customers who buy products for 300 yuan are also a waste and have no respect in the eyes of Panasonic.",
    "2. Strong odor. Even if you only charge it for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of burning plastic.",
    "The office tried it for a day and the whole room smelled like plastic.",
    "Compared with the Philips PHILIPS of the same price that I used before, although it has an extra blade, the Samsung product is really not worth the price.",
    "Small package",
    "I received the parcel and saw that it was written as \u201ce-commerce version\u201d on the package. It was smaller than the one I bought from the supermarket. It should be size M. It was different from the picture on the product introduction. It was the new version.",
    "The three stars are blaming themselves for being careless and not paying attention to the product specifications; I have no problem with the M-code e-commerce version; what do you mean by \u201cthe product is not the right version\u201d?",
    "The tricks of e-commerce are too deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy it.",
    "It is sauce purple.",
    "I don\u2019t like the taste.",
    "The kid doesn\u2019t like the taste of toothpaste, and always says it\u2019s spicy. Maybe a different word would be more appropriate. For now, that\u2019s all the kid has.",
    "I bought it when I was organizing the event, so I feel embarrassed to give it a bad review; it\u2019s four stars, but I won\u2019t buy it again.",
    "Authentic, good packaging.",
    "The packaging is complete, and an air bag is added inside. There are no online reviews except for the appearance of a single product.",
    "The outer packaging of the bottle also had a plastic film like the one described in the picture, and the delivery was also very fast, arriving the next day.",
    "It is genuine, but it is out of stock, and I don\u2019t know when it will be back in stock.",
    "A bad shopping experience.",
    "I placed an order on Black Friday, but the parcel was signed for a long time, and after checking, the parcel had been signed for a long time, and when I asked my colleagues, they said they didn\u2019t sign for it, so I contacted the courier company, but they said they could only initiate an inquiry after the sender, and I contacted Amazon customer service, and waited for more than ten days, and finally found out that the courier",
    "Wrong picture",
    "I thought I could get the earphone in Picture 1, but I got the one in Picture 2 instead. It doesn\u2019t matter that the pictures are inconsistent. What does it mean that the left and right earphones have different volume levels?",
    "Although the names are the same, we hope that everyone can pay attention to it, and we also hope that the responsible person of Amazon can replace the correct picture in time, thank you very much.",
    "The operating system is generally",
    "After using it for a while, the overall picture is still good, and there is no obvious difference; however, this system makes people feel confused; the boot time is obviously slow, and it is not easy to make good settings; the software that comes with it is not worth commenting; the response speed is even worse; it is not even a number compared with that of my colleague.",
    "The reviews said it was humanized in design, but I didn\u2019t find it humanized anywhere; the location of the remote control buttons, including the up, down, left, and right buttons, and the back button, was really not to be praised.",
    "So, just be a TV, and add a TV box and so on.",
    "The price cut is too awesome.",
    "The price is too good, from over 100 to 99 now!",
    "I had a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I used a copied comment as the rating content.",
    "If I rate this product with this sentence, it will be at least 85 points.",
    "For the inferior products, I would never be lazy to copy and paste the reviews, which would be a reference for other consumers when they purchase and help the merchants improve the quality of their products.",
    "Cheap and good line, it\u2019s enough if it doesn\u2019t burn!",
    "This is a very cheap line, but it should meet the HDMI certification standard; I personally compared it with the dog products (prices are double the price) in the domestic Akihabara, and the line is thick and soft, and the transmission of 7 meters has no noise; in the future, I will trust Belkin for low-priced lines!",
    "The product is still good, but Amazon\u2019s after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.",
    "I made a mistake after placing the order, but I can\u2019t cancel the order. The webpage to contact the online customer service always shows an error link, and I can\u2019t contact them.",
    "After receiving the goods, the delivery person called me and I said I didn\u2019t want it, and I wanted to cancel the order, but it didn\u2019t cancel successfully, and the delivery person just took it back, saying to let me sign for it first, and then I could apply for a refund.",
    "I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they are signed for when I applied for a return, and I couldn\u2019t call Amazon customer service, and they said the same thing, that food items cannot be returned once they are signed for.",
    "I have bought non-refundable items before on JD and Sunning, including milk and diapers, and I contacted customer service and they refunded me. Moreover, when I contacted customer service after receiving the diapers from JD, they smelled too bad, and they still refunded me. But this is not the case with Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, people are alive, how do you handle it when you contact your customer service?",
    "Tell me, if I want to pick it up myself, or let the delivery person buy it, why should I let the delivery person buy something that is not what I ordered?",
    "Okay, I won\u2019t back out either, I\u2019ll take it myself, but I have to give your service a 1.",
    "Please don\u2019t waste money.",
    "First, I was full of expectations when I bought it, and I thought that the Dairy brand should not be bad at all, but after receiving it, I thought the packaging was still good, the size was not bad, but there was one box that was basically soft, and it was not obvious from the appearance, but it was not tasty at all, tasteless and bland, and the flesh was dark yellow after being bitten, which was bad, and",
    "Eat one and you\u2019ll be smarter; you\u2019ll never buy fruit from an e-commerce platform again!",
    "Where is the anti-counterfeiting mark on the product?",
    "The corner of the bottle is deeply depressed, which should be caused by a strong impact; judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of destruction is heartbreaking; after all, the packaging of food is too simple; and it is still an international purchase; have you seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting marks? It is very easy to open the bottle; the most important thing is that the layer of honey inside the lid is directly blown out;",
    "I was born in China, so I don\u2019t understand it.",
    "It should be genuine, right?",
    "There were also reminders for 20 numbers when I placed the order, and this was received at 14 o\u2019clock. This is my first time shopping overseas here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe it\u2019s all normal?",
    "Delivery service needs improvement.",
    "I bought 5 vouchers in total. When I made the first reservation to withdraw 3 vouchers, only 2 were sent. After communicating with the company, I confirmed that it was a missing delivery and promised to resend it. The second time I made a reservation, it was a holiday, and the website and WeChat did not remind me that I needed to make a reservation on a working day. This caused unnecessary panic, and",
    "Nice shopping.",
    "The food is good!",
    "I still believe in Amazon\u2019s self-owned products more. Now, it is very convenient to buy from overseas. After buying from overseas, the delivery time is only a few days longer than that of domestic delivery. I have to say that Amazon\u2019s ability to clear customs for products bought from overseas is still very strong. It is much faster than transferring, so now I buy many things from overseas.",
    "I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to buy them back after going out, I hope it can be improved.",
    "Garbage",
    "When you see a package like this, do you think it is garbage on the side of the road?",
    "A plastic packaging that is easily broken, and sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is responsible for such packaging?",
    "I think that such packaging is as bad as garbage, and the product is packaged in a very simple way with no measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag. After receiving it, the packaging was completely deformed, and the items inside were damaged.",
    "If I just bumped into one like this, I recognized it, bought a few of them, and then contacted Amazon customer service, the customer service said that it could be returned, but the shipping fee would be paid by me, and then the shipping fee would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I asked, if I paid the shipping fee with cash, would you give me a gift card, and then I have to buy your gift card myself, and then I have to ship the product to your warehouse in Germany, isn\u2019t it a punishment to buy a product?",
    "I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for this problem, but the customer service didn\u2019t even say it is their responsibility, they didn\u2019t even dare to take responsibility, what kind of after-sales service is this? One word: unreliable! But I guess Amazon will not give me the chance to publish this review, they will directly delete it!",
    "Quality is good, 5 stars, but logistics is bad",
    "1, the quality is good, it is a bargain, the price is reasonable, and it is worth buying.",
    "2, solid, enough material, welding point is firm, surface treatment is appropriate, color is good.",
    "3, logistics is a pain, the order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.",
    "4, I might be satisfied if Amazon didn\u2019t mark the estimated delivery time as February 7.",
    "5, but if you mark the expected delivery time, it is equivalent to making a promise to the user, and it is difficult for the user to bear when the promise cannot be fulfilled.",
    "6, if you have no confidence to make a promise, please don\u2019t make a promise.",
    "7, Actually, I care a lot about the commitment made by the seller.",
    "8, so I got a low score.",
    "The gold wire will turn black.",
    "It still works, but whether it is obvious or not depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.",
    "There is one thing that is not good, that is the gold line. It looks good in design, but in fact, the gold line will fall off, and if you touch it a few times, your hands and the car will have some gold powder.",
    "I hope the product can be improved.",
    "This square one has no decoration effect, so don\u2019t put gold wire on it; it will fall off and make the car dirty, which is troublesome.",
    "It is in good condition and the speed is okay. It is divided into two parcels and the packaging is different.",
    "The speed is pretty fast in 8 days, but there are two parcels, and the packaging is different, obviously one is more shockproof, with thick cardboard and plastic layer, and the outer packaging is easy to be taken apart, like domestic express delivery box, and a few buffer airbags are enough, and it feels a little sloppy.",
    "The Yalan pillow is really good.",
    "The mattress of the 34CM bed is not as thick as usual, and you don\u2019t have to sleep on the mattress directly.",
    "The quality is good, both the front and back are soft, and it is very comfortable to sleep on it, and I fell asleep very quickly.",
    "The pillow arrived and there were some stains due to violent delivery by the courier. Yalan customer service was responsible and efficient in solving the problem.",
    "Not self-sold goods, Amazon is shameless.",
    "The page clearly indicates self-owned, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, and after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there is a problem, you need to contact the supplier yourself.",
    "If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier, and the order cannot be canceled; if you want to return the goods, you have successfully applied for return on Amazon, sorry, no one will help you, and you need to contact the supplier to return the goods yourself.",
    "This Nima is self-owned.",
    "The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon will not bear the after-sales service; the customer service said \u201cI will contact the supplier for you\u201d, and even claimed that it was self-owned, which is too shameless; it is naked and shameless to cheat consumers!",
    "The experience of being depressed",
    "The filter cartridge I bought from another website before has a good filtering effect, and I can use it for another day or two after 28 days without limescale.",
    "I always bought things from Amazon and they were of good quality, so I thought I would try buying them here. This was the first time I bought a filter cartridge from Amazon, and I felt it was not good. Not only did it start to have limescale as early as the first day, but there were also small black carbon powder floating in the water even after 28 days of use. I really didn\u2019t know whether to continue using it or just throw",
    "Not as good as you might imagine.",
    "Compared with the plug-in board I used before, the external workmanship is general, and I hope the internal workmanship is good after I open it up; however, from the convenience of use, whether each independent unit is powered is lacking display as described by the store.",
    "The packaging was damaged, and I waited for a while to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer package is damaged more seriously, and the inner package seems to be new, but the booklet seems not to be new; it was renovated in September, and it is a stock product; I hope it won\u2019t be bad; please explain why several customers mentioned that the package was damaged, but you were able to handle it calmly; thank you!",
    "Overall not bad, a little problem",
    "I bought a water filter pitcher for the first time, and after reading several reviews, I chose LAICA because it was relatively cost-effective. After receiving the package and following the instructions to install the filter cartridge, I tried it and felt that it was generally good, but when pouring water, the original water seemed to mix with the filtered water from the spout (the seal of the original water tank was not very tight).",
    "When using it, you must wait for all the water to pass through the filter before pouring it out!",
    "Image is incomplete.",
    "The picture didn\u2019t capture the details of the side, and the details of the side were not consistent with the main body, with a big difference; this is one; this bead is made in Thailand, but it is not marked with the place of origin; it is not marked with the material; when I bought it in the UK, each item had a box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product mark on the bead, so",
    "Be careful when buying, especially if you are buying something from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is really good.",
    "I placed an order two days ago and found that the price was reduced by 40 yuan today. I spent a lot of time looking for customer service, and the customer service said that they could not refund the price difference and that I could re-purchase and return the product.",
    "This customer experience and service is really bad compared to Taobao and Tmall.",
    "Not bad, worth trying for a beginner.",
    "It\u2019s not bad, and it\u2019s not inferior to the top-grade Jingang. I\u2019ve seen the price in the mall before, it\u2019s several hundred yuan at least. I\u2019m playing Jingang for the first time, it\u2019s okay.",
    "It\u2019s not bad.",
    "The goods are really good. I sent it to my girlfriend. However, it was a little unpleasant when the courier didn\u2019t deliver the package at noon. The courier company directly stored the package in the post office and didn\u2019t send me a confirmation message. I had to run twice.",
    "But the baby is really good.",
    "Worth buying.",
    "The little monkey is cute, and the Amazon discount is really big. I ordered it on Zhihuang\u2019s official website and received it today afternoon after placing the order last night. It\u2019s really fast.",
    "The postal and courier workers are also responsible.",
    "Huzzah!",
    "A customer's confession",
    "When you receive such a substandard product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.",
    "2 Then in the middle you contact the customer service, they will tell you that this problem will be handled by the specialist, and he will inform you of the result.",
    "You never contacted this agent actively, you don\u2019t know her work number, and there is no direct line, that is, you can\u2019t contact her, only she can contact you.",
    "Tragically, after waiting for nearly three days, the officer contacted me, but I left my phone for a while and did not receive the call from the officer.",
    "I waited for two hours and didn\u2019t get the call from the agent, so I contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service to ask her to call me back.",
    "4 days have passed since I found out that Amazon has received this defective coffee maker, and I still don\u2019t know what the processing result will be!",
    "There is no problem with the products of Amazon in the US. It is good to buy things overseas, but the service of Buyincoins is much worse than that of Amazon.",
    "6 For me, I can only continue to wait...",
    "Bottom is not flat.",
    "Because the review said it was good, I was looking forward to this pot, and I liked it when I got it. It was lightweight, but when I started cooking, I found a problem. The bottom of the pot was not flat, but raised in the middle and sunken around the edges. The oil ran to the edges, and the large pork chops I bought specifically for this pot were not covered with oil in the center. It was a mess. I couldn\u2019",
    "I don\u2019t know if I was unlucky or what, but I just got a bottom-flat pan, and I was lucky that Amazon provided a one-month return service, so I returned it.",
    "I wiped the pot clean, and I wasted half a day.",
    "Good product design needs matching manufacturing process to realize",
    "This is a product with a very simple design style.",
    "The shape of the cube is designed with a slight arc on the top.",
    "It should have been a very smooth line.",
    "Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.",
    "Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water tank cover.",
    "The curvature of the lid and the control panel were not consistent, and there was a difference of up to 2 mm after they were assembled.",
    "Although it looks like a very small gap.",
    "But it can be said to have destroyed the overall design.",
    "I feel a bit sorry for the product designer.",
    "It seems that Midea\u2019s product managers are not capable of creating products of such a level.",
    "Of course, I can\u2019t ask too much for the feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard her say that all the individual products are like this, not just the one I bought that has problems, her nonchalance and the sense of responsibility made me realize that I can\u2019t ask too much for beauty either)",
    "After the discount, it is very cheap, and it is very sad that Amazon is pretending to be a discount.",
    "It is very strong in insulation and can be purchased one week after the baby is born.",
    "There is no heat on the outside of the pot, so it won\u2019t burn you and it can effectively protect the temperature from leaking out.",
    "The air conditioning in the room kept the temperature high throughout the night.",
    "Amazon said that the 320 big deals for the annual event were available, but I found that 249,289,299 people had them. I felt cheated at first, but I compared them with other brands at the same price and found that they were still cheaper. From now on, I can bring them with me when I go out.",
    "Vitamix 6300",
    "I have been watching for a long time, and I saw that Meiya 6300 was on sale, and Xiaoyu Overseas Purchase was the same price, so I bought it quickly.",
    "I placed an order on September 2 and the estimated delivery date was September 21. However, it arrived on September 12, which was about 10 days earlier than expected. The speed is really fast!",
    "The packaging box is not big, and I directly used the original packaging of Vitamix; Amazon is not afraid that it will be broken after being shipped across the ocean!",
    "The machine looks new and has all the accessories. The only problem is that the cup on the base shakes so much that I\u2019m afraid it will fly out when I open it!",
    "I asked a friend who has 5200, and he said it didn\u2019t feel as loose as mine.",
    "The recipes included in the package are all in English, which is quite tiring to read. I couldn\u2019t find a Chinese version online, which is a nuisance!",
    "I received the package and immediately bought an inverter. I estimated that it would take 3 days to arrive. I will wait for it and then see if it is worth it!",
    "It is too small, has no parachute bag, and the material is not good.",
    "It\u2019s not even a big one!",
    "The second Totes is: 1. It doesn\u2019t have a canopy cover; 2. The material of the handle is ordinary; 3. It is written as Large, but it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and I guess it is not suitable for two people to use.",
    "On the contrary, the one I bought from Meiya can be used by three people without any pressure.",
    "I don\u2019t feel very well.",
    "First, the box is not very sturdy and deforms when you press it; second, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS from being scratched when the box is laid flat; third, the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around a rod; and so on. There are many things that are not satisfactory. Finally, the straps are a little difficult to use.",
    "PS: The wheel feels pretty good.",
    "It could be.",
    "Pros: This shoulder bag is more delicate and durable.",
    "Disadvantages: the QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what the heck is that), the 15.6 inch laptop cannot be put in (is it possible to put it in a little longer), the shoulder strap of this backpack can be locked, but the buyer is not provided with a lock, which is not service-oriented.",
    "Overall it was okay, not sure if it was real leather.",
    "The overall feeling is okay, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s genuine leather, so I can\u2019t make a judgment.",
    "It can hold A4-sized documents, and has held 80-page thick, box-shaped objects (not deformable), but it is estimated that it cannot hold objects that are too thick or too hard.",
    "The package is soft and the inner bag is divided in a more humanized way, which is still pretty good.",
    "It\u2019s just that there is a small sand pit at the bottom of the one I got, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because my character is not good or what?",
    "I was too lazy to go back and forth to exchange the product, so I endured it.",
    "Overall, it is worth four stars.",
    "ForRoyal is popular all over the world. Camera with strap. DSLR with strap.",
    "This sling design is more scientific, it is worn on both shoulders, practical, and the camera is fixed and protected on the chest with soft materials, unlike other quick shooters who use screws to fix the bottom of the camera and it is inconvenient to take off the camera.",
    "Garbage after-sales service",
    "I bought a guitar a month and a half ago, and it lacks a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me a customer service phone number. After multiple communications, the part still hasn\u2019t arrived. What kind of efficiency is this?!",
    "It is estimated that it will be more troublesome to repair after problems, and I hope that friends who are good at after-sales service will take a detour, it is too troublesome!",
    "It has some small flaws, but the sound is not bad.",
    "The headstock has a defect, missing a corner, and feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts, but this price is not bad, and the sound of the guitar is not bad.",
    "It\u2019s okay, the first dish.",
    "It has been used for a long time, and it is generally not bad except for the low sound.",
    "It is not as perfect as I imagined.",
    "The first time I bought it, the product had problems, all the lights were flashing and it couldn\u2019t be used.",
    "I asked for a replacement, but it took three days for the package to arrive in Shanghai, and it still hasn\u2019t been delivered.",
    "I also called the delivery person, but they didn\u2019t answer.",
    "The courier company said they only had that contact method.",
    "Amazon can\u2019t find a place to complain.",
    "I didn\u2019t ask for it, and the delivery was delayed for no reason, and I received a message like this.",
    "Then they talked about the transfer issue.",
    "The terrible shopping experience made me start to doubt the efficiency of Amazon's logistics and control system.",
    "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get it today.",
    "The label is not waterproof and has poor adhesive strength.",
    "Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the content printed is not waterproof and the surface is not covered with film; and the label adhesiveness is poor, it is not suitable for use on cable labels at all, and it is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy it to organize cables need to pay attention.",
    "The pen is okay, but the packaging is too simple, just a paper box, with no protection measures, and the box that holds the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent plastic, and the plastic is still on the box after being torn off.",
    "Treated like 600 yuan, very disappointed with this shopping.",
    "But the pen is not a problem.",
    "Hopefully they will improve the packaging in the future!",
    "In terms of quality, it\u2019s not that great, and in terms of writing, it\u2019s not as good as 925-25.",
    "First, let me praise the speed of the delivery of Air Parcel, it is so fast! The service attitude is also good!",
    "I have been using 925-25, it is great, and I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is great, and the style is very beautiful, I gave it four stars because the pen is a little heavy, it is not suitable for fast writing, and there is a little shaking at the position where the lead can be adjusted; in my personal opinion, 925-25 is more comfortable to use.",
    "So he became an Amazon loyalist.",
    "I bought it at a super discounted price, but my child didn\u2019t like it.",
    "It has been opened, and I tried to apply for a refund, and they even sent someone to pick it up for free.",
    "This is amazing.",
    "We don\u2019t advocate returning products, but this is the only company in China that provides such services.",
    "I hope it won\u2019t be abused.",
    "I moved the location of my book purchases to here after that.",
    "The headphones have a distortion and noise",
    "This headphone is really trash, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my ears that are the problem, or if this headphone really isn\u2019t as good as it used to be.",
    "I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com. The sound quality is not bad, and there is no noise. The bass is also not bad. I used it for more than two years and it broke. I plan to buy another one (urbeats). After all, I feel that it is not bad.",
    "I also looked at a purple one which looked nice, but when I opened it today, I felt it was not right, and the sound was getting louder and softer.",
    "I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song at first, but after listening for half an hour, I found that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound distorted, but the bass effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise. Is this only my purple one, or is the current manufacturing technology of headphones really not good?",
    "Quite a bad review, I am disappointed.",
    "I definitely have to return it tomorrow.",
    "PS is pretty.",
    "This AV amplifier is complicated in setting, crude in appearance, and has a large heat volume.",
    "The sound needs to be evaluated after a period of time!",
    "I just bought the German version of DN1080 on August 14. I found the appearance of the product to be poor.",
    "1. The front panel and the knobs are all made of plastic.",
    "The back panel has a phono input jack and a poor quality speaker output jack; a CD amplifier integrated with a power of 1000-2000 is much better than this one.",
    "3. The lid is quite thin, and it is even concave on the side of my transformer, so I had to use my hands to restore it, and the lid and front panel were loose.",
    "4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased to the transformer end, and it is awkward to move.",
    "It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just like the workmanship, made in Malaysia.",
    "Sony seems to be better than Little Horse in terms of outsourcing production in China.",
    "5. The machine is very hot, and the cover of the two-channel DVD player is about 40-50\u00b0C when touched by hand after using it for about two hours; I don\u2019t know if it is too big or if the transformer is too hot.",
    "Nowadays, I use an AC adapter more often, and this stupid transformer is estimated to weigh 4 kg.",
    "Sony should have used active noise reduction fans in the machine, but after opening the box, I only saw large aluminum heat sinks on the pipes.",
    "Little Guest.",
    "FANDUN JEEP Clothing Co., Ltd. is a garment enterprise integrating R&D, design, production, marketing and trade, mainly producing men\u2019s outdoor leisure clothing, and is a young enterprise that is booming.",
    "Fandun Jeep Fashion pays attention to the effective combination of modern information technology and traditional industry, introduces international advanced production equipment, process design and management technology, and builds the first-class garment production line in China.",
    "To pursue excellence in production and service, quality and brand, profit and public welfare.",
    "In terms of information construction, efforts are made to improve the speed and efficiency of product flow, material flow and information flow, so as to strengthen and improve the comprehensive management ability of enterprises, and to improve the overall modern management level of enterprises.",
    "The company adheres to the business philosophy of \u201csincerity, harmony, quality, excellence\u201d, and its products are popular among a wide range of customers.",
    "Van Gogh Gip\u670ds, because young, so confident!",
    "We sincerely welcome customers at home and abroad to cooperate and create brilliant future!",
    "Enterprise spirit: proactive and innovative, service purpose: customer first, sincere dedication, enterprise mission: lead the trend, establish the brand.",
    "I haven\u2019t taken it apart.",
    "The battery is in use.",
    "I really want to dissect it to see what's inside.",
    "Later, I thought that if I was disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of money; if I was satisfied after opening it, it would be difficult to put it back together and I would not like it.",
    "Well, even if Sony uses good battery cells.",
    "As for the detailed explanation of electricity, people will feel dizzy just by looking at it.",
    "I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve worked in a cell phone factory for a long time, and I\u2019m a half-baked battery engineer. I can handle it.",
    "Amazing.",
    "I really didn\u2019t have any expectations before I bought it, but I felt it was right after I opened the package!",
    "Finally, when I touched the headphone wire, I felt it was very soft and the quality was very good, and I couldn\u2019t wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.",
    "I was amazed, the sound quality was even 3D surround!",
    "I asked the salesperson in the physical store, it is about 30 yuan, but it is not a famous brand, it is a generic brand, so the Pixian brand is 27 yuan, but it is definitely worth having!",
    "The worst online shopping experience",
    "After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that the order had been shipped, but the package was still not delivered until October 12.",
    "I want to check the status of my Amazon order, but the seller didn\u2019t provide a tracking number, so I can\u2019t find out where my package is.",
    "So I sent an email to the seller to ask if they could provide the tracking number, but I didn\u2019t get a reply for two days.",
    "In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and the customer service representative told me the phone number of the seller. I called the seller again, and after a few attempts, the phone was answered. I was informed that the parcel had been lost, and I could have a new one delivered immediately.",
    "Although I was especially angry, I didn\u2019t say much to the seller because I urgently needed the computer. I just wanted it to be sent to me as soon as possible.",
    "As a result, I called the next day to ask if the package had been shipped.",
    "The seller said it hasn\u2019t been sent yet and it will be sent in the afternoon.",
    "I called again in the afternoon and the seller said it would be shipped, and it would be shipped after 5 or 6 pm. However, when I called again at 7 pm, nobody answered the phone.",
    "I called again the next morning, asking if the goods had been sent out.",
    "Can you tell me the order number?",
    "The seller said it was not shipped, and told me to order from another store if I was in a hurry, or wait until this afternoon if I could wait.",
    "I can\u2019t do that, I have to wait for a long time to place an order from another store.",
    "I can only beg the seller to send the package as soon as possible.",
    "After countless phone follow-ups, I received the computer on October 16.",
    "As for the quality of the computer, I don\u2019t know, because I bought it for someone else, so I will add a review later.",
    "I bought it half a year ago and used it a few times, and now it has been damaged. Can it be repaired?",
    "I bought a desktop computer, but I haven\u2019t used it much since then.",
    "I only take a few with me when I travel.",
    "Recently, it was found that the device would not charge when the power was connected, and it was necessary to support the charging port and the connection of the line with hands to charge.",
    "I suspect that the interface is not in good contact, and I don\u2019t know if it can be repaired now?",
    "It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!",
    "The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.",
    "I don\u2019t understand why Amazon would send EMS, which is notorious for being unreliable; well, computers are precious items after all!",
    "After the purchase, the order showed that it would be delivered on the 20th, so everyone waited at home for three days!",
    "Why does it take four or five days to send from Xiamen to Fuzhou?!",
    "On the 22nd morning, the logistics arrived in Fuzhou at last, and I was ready to receive the package happily, but in the evening, without any phone call or text message, I checked the logistics, and it turned out that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it!",
    "I was shocked at that moment!",
    "Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer really mine?",
    "I seriously doubt life!",
    "I finally brought the computer back home after running to the collection point.",
    "The specific reason is that the delivery person mixed up the two orders, but it\u2019s okay since one of them was not lost.",
    "I strongly suggest that Amazon should not use EMS anymore, and I will definitely not buy from Amazon again if Amazon uses EMS for its express delivery in the future.",
    "The goods are not bad.",
    "First, I want to say that the price was reduced after I bought it a few days ago, and the bad reviews. It is still not bad, and the price is reasonable, and the CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little dim (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not good, and the hard drive is not",
    "(By the way, do not buy keyboard stickers from a store called E Cool Digital Center in Taobao. The store is slow in shipping, the quality is poor, and the products have problems, but they do not refund or exchange them. The boss even swears a lot. I would like to expose this store.)",
    "Goods are good, but the bureaucracy of the platform is still there.",
    "The hard drive is of very good quality and has an excellent price-performance ratio. It is cheaper than buying one in Hong Kong, and if you don\u2019t need it right away and can tolerate the shipping, I would definitely recommend buying it.",
    "But the bureaucracy of Amazon platform is still unchanged as it was years ago when I swore I would never use it again. You can never find out the actual logistics situation. Information will always be delivered in a few weeks, and you can never complain. This is just so bureaucratic!",
    "The goods arrived a few days ago, but the logistics information is that you will receive the goods in 10 days!",
    "Logistics is not thoughtful.",
    "It was delivered in this state, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electrical appliance packaging was also open, and I don\u2019t know if it was re-packaged.",
    "FYI",
    "Haven\u2019t tried it yet, but I always trust Philips, and I hope the battery life is longer than other brands.",
    "I searched online, and it is a common problem with water damage, and it is not covered by warranty.",
    "Depressing!",
    "Now wrap it with a plastic wrap and continue to use it, I don\u2019t know how long it can be used.",
    "Bought from someone who has taken it apart.",
    "It is indeed more expensive to pay taxes of more than three hundred for a machine that costs less than one hundred; I feel more comfortable now that it costs more than six hundred.",
    "When I received it, the seal looked very strange, like it had been opened, so I took a photo first, and sure enough, it was opened when I tore it; the paper board inside was damaged, and I was worried that it was returned by someone else; before my anniversary, I tried it on my husband first, but the machine didn\u2019t work at all; luckily, there was no hair in the blade, otherwise I would have to return",
    "It is good to use or there may be some problems in the short term, and the things sent out when out of stock are really not reliable, as the previous review said.",
    "Experience level is slightly above average",
    "It is almost top-level electric toothbrush, and there are many types of brushing modes, but few people will change different modes every day.",
    "I used it for half a year and there was no problem. I brushed it every day, and it was fine for about one and a half weeks.",
    "The brush head accessories are also cheap on Amazon.",
    "The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the color, other problems that seem to be compatible are the cause of the overseas version?",
    "I want to learn the law.",
    "The price-performance ratio is very high.",
    "I have used it 3-4 times.",
    "1. The packaging is in good condition.",
    "2, very simple to use, and easy to clean.",
    "3\u3001 You can do your hair by yourself, which saves money.",
    "Overall, a very successful purchase.",
    "Fake products.",
    "I bought two bags of it last time, and it turned out to be two different versions. The word on the lower left corner of the package was green, but one of them was not, and the word was white. The cat got sick after eating it.",
    "I am not sure if the goods source of Amazon is fake or if the staff dropped the package when shipping.",
    "I will buy it again, and if it is still fake, I will find the relevant person in charge to hold you responsible.",
    "It's a horizontal beam!",
    "The picture on Amazon is of an inclined ladder, but I received a horizontal ladder, is this a scam?",
    "The effect is okay.",
    "The cat likes to eat, that\u2019s the point.",
    "It really works.",
    "Tight, narrow, ankle cuffs, and grinders.",
    "Not recommended.",
    "1.UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately this one is too bad.",
    "Additional: Today I compared the UN series insole (the shoe was thrown away and the insole was kept) with the previous one, and the material was much worse than before, the elasticity was not as good as before, and the breathability was not as good as before, and it was just fake soft.",
    "2. My heel is not high, and the playing part is about 3 cm forward from the highest part of my heel.",
    "3. I bought three pairs of Clarks shoes online, but only one pair fits me.",
    "I was so scared that I deleted all of his songs from my playlist.",
    "Try rockport again, if it doesn\u2019t work, you can go to ecco physical store.",
    "Substandard goods, poor quality control",
    "First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime International Shopping is powerful, and the parcel was received on the 6th after being shipped on the 31st.",
    "The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the texture is good.",
    "The shoe size is a little bit bigger, 25 is 10.5 wide and 7.5W, the top of the shoe is a little bit loose, but I usually like to wear a little loose, and I just put a pair of insoles in it.",
    "Secondly, the shoe quality control person is really not qualified. One shoe sole has a damage, and the other shoe face has various scratches and a pinhole, and the adhesive tape of the shoe face and shoe sole is misaligned, it is obviously a second-rate product!",
    "I regret it a little!",
    "I bought this for NT$280 from the activity, and it\u2019s quite a bargain to buy it from Arthur\u2019s; of course, there are even lower prices if you look at the reviews.",
    "Now let\u2019s talk about the shoes, pros: the shoes are light, running in them is comfortable, and they fit my feet well, and they don\u2019t slip around.",
    "The appearance is good but the disadvantage is also obvious: I usually wear shoes of size 40, and I bought shoes of size 40.5 this time, and there is still about one thumb\u2019s length distance from the front of the shoe when I put it on, but it doesn\u2019t affect anything.",
    "The shoes are very \u201cnarrow\u201d, although there is still a distance in front, but it feels tight.",
    "One more thing, the shoes are not breathable and I feel like my feet are hot.",
    "Heel strike.",
    "First, the shoes are well made and worth the price.",
    "My feet are standard, I wear size uk7.5, eu41.5, love walking shoes from Amazon, and I have never had a problem with them, but I bought this pair according to the reviews, and it is a size uk7, which is a size larger than I usually wear, and it is obviously too long, but the cushion is too thick, and it is still very uncomfortable to wear, and the shoes are very hard,",
    "If your feet are not particularly thin, I do not recommend buying this one.",
    "If you must buy it, you can replace the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, so it\u2019s a pity.",
    "A very perfect shopping!",
    "I am very satisfied and love it very much. There is no doubt that the product from Amazon Global Selling is genuine. The quality is also very good, and the price is reasonable. I feel at ease when I buy it. The after-sales service is thoughtful, and the customer service staff are very kind and polite. They are patient and efficient in solving problems, and they have solved my worries perfectly. The delivery service is very convenient and reliable. The delivery person",
    "Anyway, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon overseas!",
    "Absolutely bad review!",
    "It is really hard to talk about this agency and Amazon.",
    "Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.",
    "Although it has been a long time, I still have to complain.",
    "I bought it on sale for less than 200 yuan, and I haven\u2019t used it for a few months at home.",
    "When I wanted to use it in spring, I found that it couldn\u2019t connect with the watch, and the manuals of both devices said that they supported each other. Later, I found that it was a problem with the heart rate strap, because I tried to connect it with other devices and it still couldn\u2019t connect.",
    "I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agent, and the agent asked me to pay for the device to be sent to Shanghai for testing.",
    "After almost half a month, the items were sent back to me in their original packaging, even the box was the one I used to send them!",
    "No response and follow-up and test report!",
    "You should have told me sooner, whether it was good or bad!",
    "I called and was told that sending it back like this would indicate that the device was not faulty, which was good.",
    "But I still can\u2019t connect, and the proxy company replied: It\u2019s not their business.",
    "I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to waste my time on a 200 yuan item that you\u2019ve ruined.",
    "The goods were seriously not up to par.",
    "The product is not what I expected.",
    "The headband material is good.",
    "It is much better than Nike.",
    "It is also breathable.",
    "Just that hat up front.",
    "It is very fine.",
    "Do you want to come and be funny?!",
    "It is not completely covered by the sun.",
    "I didn\u2019t return it because it worked well as a headband.",
    "It is not effective in blocking the sun when worn on the head.",
    "But it is different from other headbands.",
    "Leave it on.",
    "The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks contract spirit, and the delivery person is good.",
    "I want the delivery on Saturday and Sunday!",
    "Amazon\u2019s rules do not allow deliveries on Saturdays and Sundays.",
    "I had to drive 200 km from the countryside to come and pick up the goods!",
    "Amazon, how can I love you more?",
    "The delivery person was very active and enthusiastic.",
    "Give a compliment!",
    "The goods, I tried it simple, it is not bad.",
    "But I have never bought similar products before, so I can\u2019t compare the prices!",
    "Size and logistics.",
    "The workmanship is good, but the logistics is too slow. Previously, all the shoes were delivered by DHL. This time, Apex is\u2026 I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low. I feel that it is higher than NIKE and ADIDAS?",
    "They are all the same, so I will buy them online.",
    "Size: I am 176cm tall and weigh 68kg. My shoulders are about 180cm wide, and I bought M, which is slightly long. Other than that, I wore it just right. I see that there are people who recommend S size. Do you have a slim figure? Or do you like tight clothes? I think the hat and shirt are a bit loose.",
    "Just the right size.",
    "Chest circumference: 99, height: 184, weight: 84 kg, before purchasing, I consulted the customer service and was told to buy XXL, and then I decided to buy L after reading the reviews, and after receiving the package, I found that the size was just right, and I almost got cheated.",
    "The price of Double 11 is much higher than that of Black Friday.",
    "The quality of the clothes is very good.",
    "Z Convenience\u2019s problematic goods are a pain!",
    "I ordered it on the 18th, and the goods only arrived on the 25th. The speed of snails from Guangzhou to Beijing!",
    "I bought the Z Deals product, and the description said it would leave scratches, but after receiving the package, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!",
    "The child didn\u2019t want to return the item, thinking it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but the accessory was a small part and the child\u2019s grandpa couldn\u2019t find it in any of the hardware stores nearby!",
    "Finally, the grandpa pasted it!",
    "It seems that we can\u2019t buy Z affordable products anymore!",
    "The toy is of poor quality.",
    "Most of the screw holes didn\u2019t match up, and it was hard to screw on the top screws, indicating poor workmanship. I don\u2019t know how long it can be played with, because it was promised to the child, so I can\u2019t return it.",
    "Other reviews say the installation is easy, does anyone else have a problem with the one I bought?",
    "It was so-so.",
    "Is it that I am not lucky?",
    "The packaging is old and not good; the workmanship is very poor; there is only one type of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just shaking your head and walking forward, with no changes.",
    "Not worth the price.",
    "If you need it urgently, you can\u2019t return it.",
    "The toy is of good quality, but the packaging is a bit of a letdown.",
    "I received the parcel delivered by EMS yesterday, which was ordered from Amazon. It was finally delivered by the courier of Tmall. How many turns did it make? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?",
    "As for the packaging, it is wrapped with several layers of fresh-keeping films, and there is no packaging plastic bubble paper inside; when you open it, all the parts are placed in a box that is empty, and luckily the toy quality is good, and there are no broken parts; however, it is much smaller than I imagined, because it is not battery-operated, and it often derails when pushed by hand, and it feels that",
    "Good quality, fun to play.",
    "It\u2019s fun to play, the precision of components is high, the workmanship is exquisite, and the quality is almost the same as Lego. The price is very cheap when you hold an activity.",
    "The process of assembling is quite interesting, I came to assemble it, and my 5-year-old son came to play, it\u2019s quite good.",
    "He laughed and laughed while playing it~ He will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.",
    "The car is new and the price is good.",
    "I watched it on Christmas Day, and it was 150 yuan more expensive than the one I bought before. However, the new one is a little slower.",
    "The cars are not bad, they are all new.",
    "PiKachu is built-in.",
    "Then connect the spirit ball and you will receive a fantasy.",
    "It\u2019s not bad to play, and it\u2019s more portable than the PS4.",
    "I bought Zelda, waited for the game, and then tried again.",
    "Produced bad products, sold bad products, and the result is bad service. I bought six watches for my children, and one of the numbers on the watches was not complete, and the time on all six watches was not consistent, ranging from a few hours to more than ten hours.",
    "I contacted the manufacturer and asked about the verification time of the watch when it was received. They replied that \u201cthere was\u201d. If there was, then why was there such a big difference in time? It was obvious that the watch was not accurate and was a fake product. It was not hard to tell that the watch was a fake product (the numbers were not complete). The obvious quality problem (the numbers were not complete) was taken out to sell. Was it a fake product",
    "I contacted the seller, and the seller gave me a lot of reasons, and also blamed me for buying their products in the first place, products like this, sellers like this, and after-sales service like this, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.",
    "In short, I suggest that you don\u2019t buy anything from this seller, and even if you do, it will be a waste of money.",
    "Amazon shipping problem",
    "After receiving the goods, I found that:",
    "1. The table packaging is seriously damaged.",
    "2. The table description has serious wrinkles.",
    "3, the clock does not go, the table lamp is not charged and cannot be adjusted.",
    "4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only send it to the US at your own expense, and pay for the return shipping.",
    "5\u3001The reason for 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.",
    "It can only be said that it fits together.",
    "The time is not very accurate, about one second per day, and it has been almost two and a half months since I started using it.",
    "I used to use a piece of the West Rail City, and I feel that it won\u2019t be a few seconds off in a year or two.",
    "The calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is a bit useless, and it is rarely used and occasionally mistakenly touched to enter the timer mode.",
    "Solar Powered Watch",
    "Pros: Solar charging, no need to worry about changing batteries, world time, multiple alarm sounds and hourly reminders.",
    "The downsides are that the surface is easy to scratch and dust can enter.",
    "Cost performance: the general price in China is between 220 and 300 yuan, and the price overseas is more than 180 yuan (it takes about a week to arrive).",
    "Very satisfied with the watch.",
    "It must be genuine. I checked the goods at the store and the appearance of the watch is beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, the material is sufficient, and it is also an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight; it is not something that so-called mechanical watches of three or four hundred can compare with. This is a genuine product.",
    "The watch is very accurate and the error is within an acceptable range. The watch comes with a certificate of authenticity for jewelry appraisal. The 12 stones on the watch face are real diamonds. It is very suitable for me to wear and it is also very impressive as a gift.",
    "Benny is a good choice.",
    "The worst shopping experience ever.",
    "On the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, and I immediately ordered an 8P from Amazon Malaysia. The product was in stock but not self-owned and there was no extra charge (I was secretly happy), and because it was not self-owned, the delivery was slower. The system showed that the product was expected to be delivered on September 27 at the latest.",
    "My wife couldn\u2019t bear it and died without a phone. Early in the morning at 6:30, she asked me to think of a solution. Later, I checked JD.com and found that there was a 256G one in stock that could be delivered on the same day. I immediately ordered another one.",
    "The new one was bought, and I immediately thought of canceling the Amazon order.",
    "Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to pick up the parcel in the morning, and at 7:30, I called customer service to cancel the order, and the customer service representative said that the order had been canceled and to wait for the notification by SMS.",
    "Okay, I will wait patiently. When I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the status of not shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to request to cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service replied that it was already OK.",
    "At 3 p.m., I checked my phone and found that the order was still there. I could not help but contact the customer service again to make it clear that I had called three times, and asked them to cancel the order and inform the seller that the package must not be shipped!",
    "The customer service contacted the seller immediately after my request, and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that I would have to wait until the seller was familiar with the system before the cancellation of the order could be processed.",
    "But I was clearly told by the seller that they knew about it and would definitely not ship the package, so please rest assured.",
    "I checked the order status on Monday and found that it had been shipped, so I was speechless.",
    "Unable to contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.",
    "The handling after that was simply inexpressible, and basically, I would say one thing, and the customer service would then do something.",
    "The order is still in the rejected state, and is being prepared to be sent again!",
    "Won\u2019t Amazon follow up on its own?",
    "The company that sold it didn\u2019t care and didn\u2019t follow up.",
    "From now on, I will never prepay for large items again. This is too troublesome.",
    "It looks beautiful.",
    "I have been eyeing this camera for a long time, but I didn\u2019t buy it because of some other reasons besides the price, so I bought it this time because of the bundle shipping and the reasonable price.",
    "There was no problem with the other things after I bought it, but it couldn\u2019t connect to the software when I connected it. My router is TP\u2019s router, and after searching online, I found that many people had this problem. I spent more than two hours to change the settings of the router, and finally I used 360WIFI as the medium to solve the problem. In the meantime, I called the customer service of Xiaomi, but they didn",
    "Another point worth noting is that I found in the user reviews online that the camera supports a minimum of 8G storage card, and the storage capacity smaller than 8G cannot be identified, so please pay attention to this.",
    "It feels good to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, and the machine has a certain degree of heating, and it feels a little unacceptable to heat to this extent if it is always turned on.",
    "As mentioned above, there are many shortcomings in this product, and I hope everyone will be careful when buying it.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because this is the one I bought when I was in love with life, and I have been dating it for almost 3 years, and it left me last year, and I still miss it.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because this is the one I bought for my first love in life, and I don\u2019t know how far I\u2019ve used it; maybe I\u2019ve thrown it away!",
    "We have been in contact for almost 3 years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think of her, I feel so sad that I want to leave this world. The first woman in my life has brought me a shadow and sadness for a lifetime, and I still can\u2019t get over it.",
    "When I bought the phone, I thought that we could bear it together, but now it is unbearable to recall. Maybe life is like this, some people never want to meet them in their lifetime, and some things are things that they never want to know, but what can we do?",
    "How many times have I seen a Samsung phone and thought of her, and the pain that comes with it, fills my whole body; I have never used a phone worth more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate for a moment; no matter how good a person is, when she changes her mind, all the promises and vows will disappear into thin air.",
    "A masterpiece among domestic brands",
    "Huawei is a fine product among national goods.",
    "The low-key CEO and the company rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business trend of relying on advertising to improve brand awareness!",
    "Enterprises without strength are absolutely not able to do this, and they dare not do this!",
    "It is precisely because of this that I chose Huawei.",
    "I bought it more than half a year ago, and it has been working well, which is very good.",
    "I didn't give it a full five stars because once when I was using it offline for navigation, it had a location issue and I couldn't figure out why, but other than that it's been great.",
    "Moreover, it\u2019s online input is good and it can design a route after searching, and it\u2019s useful to automatically navigate offline after leaving the WiFi, and it doesn\u2019t need to use traffic, it directly talks to the satellite to realize location and navigation, which is great!",
    "Sony is great.",
    "Sony\u2019s low-end phone is still designed well, and it is cheap, with a large screen and excellent battery life, which is very suitable for the elderly.",
    "Although a long time has passed, the machine still works fine.",
    "However, since my Z2 was downgraded, this phone has also fulfilled its mission."
