    "Two vehicles are currently being used for the trial in the after-school English conversation school for children \"teracoya THANK (TeraCoya Thank)\" operated by the company in Chiryu City.",
    "Three motion sensors, which detect movement by the difference in temperature between a person and their surroundings, have been installed on the ceiling of the car.",
    "When the vehicle engine is turned off and the door is closed, and a certain time has passed, if it detects human movement, it will automatically send a warning notification.",
    "By linking the engine and door status with information, it is possible to prevent false alarms as much as possible.",
    "The warning is sent via the cloud.",
    "The number is also displayed on the computer or smartphone chat.",

    "For example, it was able to identify various issues related to the school bus, such as the driver's environment that allows them to concentrate on driving.",
    "\"If we can expand the scope of the solution, we will do our best.\"",
    "The reason for the development of a system to prevent leaving things behind was an accident in which a bus that was following another bus nationwide left something behind.",

    "I have a sticker that says \"24 hour security camera in operation\".",
    "It's an original product from a security camera manufacturer I used to use.",
    "It's more effective to stick the manufacturer's sticker on than the one sold at the home center.",

    "The only thing left is durability.",
    "I don't think I'll use it that much, but I think it's a good toolbox item.",
    "I bought it together with an empty seller's \"1/4 inch hexagonal kick magnetic quick release driver bit holder 60/100/150 mm\"",
    "This was also problem free, and I was very pleased with the price.",
    "The controller stops working.",
    "The drill just moves on its own and can't be operated.",
    "If you disconnect and reconnect the cable, it will work, but after a few minutes, the drone will move in a direction you don't want and you won't be able to control it.",
    "I would not recommend this product.",
    "I'm warning you all.",
    "It's a cool product.",
    "It's wired, so I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable, and I've used it for a long time and it's still in good condition.",
    "It can also be used for PC games.",

    "Does this increase the calculation power?",
    "I think it's for kids who can understand calculations.",
    "Is it not possible for a child who does not understand calculations to some extent?",
    "The problems are too difficult.",
    "Also, when giving tools to parents, you have to point to the screen and move it up, but I tried doing it myself and it never gets smooth no matter how many times I do it.",
    "Maybe it's easier for someone who's used to the DS to show you?",
    "I can't get into the illustrations of manga characters, or at least I think it's because of the appeal of the screen on the DS... I can't get attached to them for some reason.",
    "The way the math is done is also in a race against time, like how many questions you can answer in a certain amount of time.",
    "I understand the need to rush during tests, but is it possible to make it more like a puzzle that you have to figure out instead of just rushing?",
    "I don't like the gong that sounds when you finish.",
    "Why not make it a more pleasant sounding one, even though you're working so hard?",
    "This makes me feel like I lost 6,200 yen.",
    "I can understand this price if it's half.",
    "Sorry, I translated it as 2.",
    "I really like Persona's songs!",
    "The Persona 3 side reaches the ED.",
    "I played until part 5.",
    "Persona 4 is completed on Vita.",
    "The only thing that changed from Persona 4 is that you can't get them anymore.",
    "It feels shorter than the previous one, and it doesn't have a story.",
    "The music is really catchy!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "The characters in Persona 3 were the first to be HD, so I was moved when I first saw them.",
    "Somehow, Junpei looks like a handsome guy (laugh) Persona 5 is beautiful from the start, so there's nothing new... When I think that way, I feel that 3 is more worth it.",
    "As a soundtrack, I felt that 5 was easier to listen to than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is blue-themed, but it was hard to see when the background was dark.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even when it's against the background.",
    "With all the assist functions, I think even people who are bad at audio will be able to play it.",
    "For those who are good at rhythm games, the challenge function may make the game too difficult to play.",
    "The triple pack comes with santolla, but it's a full 4 pack, not just an omake, so I recommend this for those who like Persona's songs.",
    "It's a shame.",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the picture, but the actual product is a little more blue than black, and closer to charcoal grey.",
    "And it wasn't double buckled.",
    "I was thinking of buying gold too, but I'm holding off for now.  I think the price is low, so I might not give up.",
    "Edit: I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange it for a new one after the review was posted.",
    "The subsequent handling was also quick.",
    "I think the response was excellent, regardless of the price of the item.",
    "Four stars for the response. Update: I also bought the gold.",
    "I think the colour is almost exactly as in the photo and it is very beautiful.",
    "But the buckle is not double-locked as shown in the description photo.",
    "That's the only downside.",
    "It gets a little heavy in the evening.",
    "I used it on a SIM-free iPhone 7s.",
    "At first, I didn't know how to do it when I arrived in Korea and pointed to my SIM card, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Kobe Airport and she taught me (Settings > Mobile Communications > Communication Options, turn on Data Roaming).",
    "The instructions that came with the product didn't seem to be very relevant...?",
    "However, around Gimpo airport, the signal was poor and I couldn't get 3G for a long time.",
    "It turned into 4G when I went to the city.",
    "Sometimes the communication became heavy in the evening or at night, and I think I reached the maximum of 1GB per day.",
    "Better than I expected",
    "I used SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim free and used it with Ymobile, but since Z4 was not doing well, I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that can be used with a new SIM card, and I bought it.",
    "I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use it properly since I was using Mobile Suica, but there were no problems at all.",
    "The size, weight, and silver color make it look like an iPhone 6 to me.",
    "I don't play games so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, but it seems a little faster.  I heard that the review, fingerprint recognition is slow, but it seems to take a little time to recognize, so I use face recognition because it is faster.",
    "I thought it was amazing, just like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase, even though I had upgraded to Android version 9.",
    "I have a few things I noticed 1. It could be a little smaller 2. It doesn't have a strap hole \u203bIt can be used with a case that has a strap hole 3. I haven't tested its waterproofness yet 4. It's a little heavy 5. I haven't used it much yet but I'm satisfied 6. I recommend it"
