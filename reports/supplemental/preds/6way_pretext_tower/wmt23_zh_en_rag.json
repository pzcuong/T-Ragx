    "COVID-19 could lead to further expansion of drug markets COVID-19 pandemic could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of reduced state control or because of the economic crisis, which may force more people into illicit activities.",
    "The restrictions related to COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, which has likely increased maritime trafficking, which is less risky and more numerous than air or land smuggling.",

    "Many of the new psychoactive substances that are fentanyl analogues have been shown to be effective and dangerous , causing overdose deaths in North America and elsewhere , but to a lesser extent .",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs , including cocaine and methamphetamine , and is also used to make counterfeit prescription opioids .",
    "evidence of injection of new psychoactive substances of abuse in Europe has emerged : a study of waste syringes in six European cities found that many contained new psychoactive substances of abuse that produce stimulant effects .",
    "the use of new psychoactive substances may be increasingly entrenched among disadvantaged populations .",

This has been confirmed in studies in high @-@ income countries , where the social @-@ economic trajectory of individuals is not only their status at a given point in time , but also related to the risk of drug @-@ use disorders .",
    "the social and economic disadvantage associated with addiction is compounded by the risk of unemployment , poverty , and homelessness , which in turn perpetuates the vicious cycle of disadvantage . These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system .",

    "But alcohol seems to play a bigger role in violent incidents than drugs.",
    "Although drug use may lead to criminality , in some cases , this association can be partly attributed to multiple mediators , such as socioeconomic disadvantage , and other types of adversity , such as those caused by individual risk factors , family environment , and peers .",
    "The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence.",
    "In the short term, the existence and intensity of violence is more dependent on changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.",

    "By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "But the related hazards of opioids are often overlooked because they are less commonly used.",
    "of the estimated 167,000 drug @-@ related deaths in 2017 , 66 % were caused by these substances , and 50 % of the estimated 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death that were believed to be drug @-@ related .",
    "Synthetic opioid misuse exacerbates public health crisis",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the crisis is driven by tramadol; in North America, it is fentanyl. The two regions have almost nothing in common in terms of economic, demographic, or drug use patterns, but they are both struggling with an opioid crisis fueled by the availability and low cost of materials to produce them.",
    "in North America , the use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to a surge in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years .",
    "Two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States in 2018 involved fentanyl.",
    "Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.",
    "Part of the reason fentanyl causes overdose deaths is that the potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market is unpredictable.",
    "the market for nonmedical use of tramadol has grown substantially in West Africa , Central Africa , and North Africa .",
    "in the region, the use of tramadol for the treatment of the condition is increasing among patients.",
    "In 2017, the global seizures of tramadol increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.",
    "The crisis in both places was fueled by the availability of simple and inexpensive manufacturing, as well as a lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl-like substances or their precursors.",
    "The crisis in both places is exacerbated by the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and the illicit markets, making it harder to detect and prevent their abuse.",
    "Use of stimulants continues to rise",
    "the cocaine and methamphetamine markets are the most significant in the stimulant field , with both substances experiencing increasing levels of use in their primary markets .",
    "About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.",
    "an estimated 27 million people used amphetamines in 2009 , with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America .",
    "according to most indicators , methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for two decades .",
    "in some markets , cocaine and methamphetamine coexist and sometimes substitute for each other , with the use of one drug rising as the use of the other falls and sometimes both increasing and decreasing to meet the same market demand .",
    "COVID-19 increases risk for injection drug users",
    "an estimated 11.3 million people inject drugs , and about 10 % of global HIV infections are attributed to injecting drug use .",
    "More than 1 million people who inject drugs are living with HIV, and 5.5 million are living with hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug overdoses, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which is still largely untreated among people who inject drugs.",
    "5 the shortage of opioids caused by COVID @-@ 19 restrictions may lead to users substituting with more readily available substances , such as alcohol or benzodiazepines , or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs .",

    "John Kirby, the strategic communications coordinator for the National Security Council at the White House, said on Friday that while the specific nature of the object flying at high altitude was unclear, it \"posed a reasonable threat to civil aviation.\"",

    "\"We call it a 'thing' because that's the best description we can give it right now,\" Kobe said.",
    "Biden listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the strike, and he made the decision \"with great care,\" Cobie added.",
    "The official description of the object from the US authorities can be roughly summarized as follows: the size is about that of a small car, it has no joystick, no suspension, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.",
    "But this information still does not answer the basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what its mission is.",
    "Many online analyses and speculations suggest that it could be another Chinese balloon.",
    "It may have been launched by China, like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, performing some sort of mission.",
    "Some have linked the Alaska \"object\" to an \"unidentified flying object\" (UFO).",
    "\"I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO,\" former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer tweeted on Friday, according to a report by Newsweek.",
    "\"The irony of mixing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict,\" Meijer said.",
    "MJ tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed the Alaska object was shot down.",
    "Newsweek said that Maj. Gen. Garcia is not the only one who doubts that the object was a UFO.",

    "Then the customer service informed me to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.",
    "Is this how Amazon handles these situations?",

    "Objectively, I have no proof that I did not damage the product, but based on my Amazon shopping history, I think that such products should not appear in Amazon's own products, customers choose Amazon is trust, customer win, we win, customer's victory is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone will work together to improve, thank you.",

    "The authors' ideas are expressed more through techniques and structures than through story, which also makes the reading experience less engaging.",
    "It is suitable for rough reading, but not for detailed reading.",
    "The book is well-logical, but not enough content.",
    "It explains what and why a lot of sales theories are, but is weak on how to do it, just pointing out the direction but not giving specifics.",
    "Also, the book felt like it was pieced together.",
    "For example, there are both domestic and foreign; both famous entrepreneurs or salesmen and people who are not well-known.",
    "I don't know if it's a story compiled for the sake of example, and if some cases experienced by the author are added, it will be more convincing.",
    "The customer is still the customer.",
    "The title is still customer, but the content has become customer.",
    "The e-book also had problems with misspellings, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering.",

    "A Quick Guide to Fintech",
    "This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is only an introduction, it can help you quickly understand the overall situation of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig it yourself.",
    "And it was written earlier, and the later Alipay and WeChat Pay subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned, and the current proportion of third-party payments is probably not as small as it was in the book.",
    "Now many people take their mobile phones with them when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank flow.",
    "But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introduction book, which shows that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the financial development history at home and abroad, so it can write such popular and easy-to-understand content.",

    "In this book, the author explains the five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, physical touch, and receiving gifts.",
    "I think the important thing is not to know what the five languages of appreciation are, but to be able to use them at all times, to be able to use them from the heart, to be able to use them to appreciate and to be grateful to the people around you, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues.",

    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it is also OK to use, but it is not as good as I expected.",
    "weaknesses:",
    "1. No indicator light for charging, this is the most basic, you have saved on your power indicator, and I estimate that customers who buy products for 300 yuan are also a waste of money, and have no respect.",
    "2. Strong odor. When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of burning plastic.",
    "I tried it in my office for a day and it smelled like plastic all over the house.",
    "Compared with the same priced Philips PHILIPS I used before, although it has more blades, the quality of this Panasonic product is really not worthy of consumers.",
    "small packaging",
    "I received the parcel and saw that it was written as the e-commerce version. I knew that I had been cheated again. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be M. It was not the same as the picture on the product introduction. It was the new version.",
    "Three stars are blamed on yourself for being careless and not looking at the product specifications. Do you sell M code for the merchant version? I have no opinion. Are you selling the wrong version?",

    "original packaging, original product.",
    "The packaging is complete, with an air bag inside, and there are no online reviews except for the appearance of the product.",
    "The plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle is the same as described in the picture, and the delivery is also fast, and the second day's delivery arrived.",
    "It's genuine, but it's out of stock and I don't know when it will be restocked.",
    "A bad shopping experience",
    "I ordered something on Black Friday, but it never arrived. When I checked, I found out that the package had already been signed for, but none of my colleagues had signed for it. I contacted the courier company, but they said that they could only initiate an investigation after the package had been sent. I contacted Amazon customer service, and I had to wait more than ten days before they finally found out that the package had been delivered to the wrong person. After a few",
    "Wrong picture.",
    "I thought I could get the headphones like the picture 1, but I got the headphones like the picture 2, the object is not consistent, and the left and right sound volume is not consistent, what does it mean?",
    "Although the names are the same, I hope you can pay attention to it carefully, and I also hope that the Amazon leaders can replace the correct picture in time, thank you very much.",
    "the operating system is generally",
    "It took a while, but overall the picture is still good, there is no difference, but this system makes people confused, the boot time is obviously a little slow, and it is not possible to make good settings, and the software that comes with it is not worth commenting on, the response speed is even worse, and it is not a number compared to my colleague\u2019s.",
    "I read the reviews saying it was very user friendly, I couldn't find it user friendly, the placement of the remote control, the up down left right, the return key is just not user friendly.",
    "So, you know, just be a TV, and add a TV box or something.",
    "The price drop is too awesome.",
    "The price drop is too awesome, from over 100 to 99 now!",
    "I had a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I just copied a review and pasted it.",
    "If I were to rate this product, I would say it is at least 85 out of 100.",
    "I would never be lazy to copy and paste the reviews for the bad products, because other consumers would use this as a reference when buying, and the seller would also improve the quality of the products.",
    "Low price is good, no fever is enough!",
    "This cheap line should have reached the HDMI certification standard, and it is personally compared to the dog shit in Akihabara (the price is doubled), the line is thick and soft, the 7m transmission has no noise, and the low-priced line is recognized by Benshi in the future!",
    "The item is fine but the after sales service from Amazon is really bad compared to other websites",
    "I made a mistake in my order, but I can't cancel it, the website is showing me an error link and I can't contact the online customer service.",
    "After the delivery, the delivery man called me and I said I didn\u2019t want it, I tried to cancel the order but it didn\u2019t work, the delivery man took it back and said to sign for it first and then I could apply for a return.",
    "When I applied for the return, I was informed that the food items could not be returned once they were signed for, and I could not call Amazon customer service, who said the same thing, that the food items could not be returned once they were signed for.",
    "I have bought non-returnable items before on JD and Sunning, including milk and diapers, and contacted customer service to return them, and they returned them, and when I opened the diapers from JD, they smelled too much, so I contacted customer service and they returned them, but now you can\u2019t return them on Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?",
    "Tell me whether I should pick it up myself or let the delivery person pick it up, it\u2019s already hard enough for the delivery person, why should I let the delivery person pay for something that I didn\u2019t buy?",
    "okay, I won't back out, I'll take it myself, but I have to give you a 1-star service",
    "Please don't waste your money",
    "First, I was looking forward to buying, I thought the Lulu brand should not be bad, but when I received it, I thought the packaging was still good, the size was not bad, but there was one box that was basically soft, and it was not visible from the outside, so I needed to feel it, and when I ate it, there was no taste at all, it was tasteless, and when I bit it, the fruit flesh was dark yellow",
    "Save yourself some time by buying clever.",
    "Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark",
    "The corner of the bottle base is impressive, it should be caused by a strong impact, and the degree of plague is heartbreaking, after all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is still an international purchase, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeit mark, and it is very easy to open the bottle, the key is that the layer of honey inside the lid directly comes out, there is almost no adhesive, is this",
    "I was born in China, so I don't understand.",
    "it should be genuine, right?",
    "Also, when I took the photo, it was suggested that I should take 20s, but this one was taken at 14s, and I bought it abroad for the first time, so I just wrote down my doubts, maybe it\u2019s all normal?",
    "Delivery service needs to improve.",
    "I bought 5 vouchers, and when I made the first appointment, I was only able to pick up 3, and only 2 were sent, and after much communication, it was confirmed that they were not sent, and that they would be sent after the appointment was made; the second appointment was made on a day off, and neither the website nor WeChat indicated that an appointment would be required on a workday, which caused unnecessary panic, and it was recommended that",
    "very good shopping experience.",
    "Good things!",
    "I still believe in Amazon's self-owned things, and now it's very convenient to buy abroad, and the logistics time from abroad is only a few days longer than that of the country, and I have to say that Amazon's clearance ability for buying things from abroad is still very strong, and it is much faster than transferring, so now many things are bought abroad.",
    "I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to go out and buy them back than to buy them in China, and I hope it will be improved.",
    "garbage.",
    "When you see a package like this, do you think it's trash?",
    "A plastic-shattering packaging, sent from Germany in a plastic bag, is that responsible?",
    "I think this kind of packaging is like garbage, and the product is purchased, the packaging is very simple, there is no measure to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after receiving it, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.",
    "If I just ran into one of these, I would have known, bought a few of these, called Amazon customer service, and they would have said yes, you can return it, but you have to pay for shipping, and then the shipping would have been returned to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I ask, I pay the shipping fee with cash, you give me a gift card, it is to tell me to buy your gift card, and I have to send the product to the German warehouse, it is to buy the product and suffer!",
    "I have been telling customer service that who is responsible for this problem, but they dare not take responsibility even for half a sentence, so what guarantee do you have for after-sales service? One word: screw! But I estimate that Amazon will not give me the opportunity to publish this evaluation, so I will directly delete it!",
    "Quality is good, 5 stars, logistics is bad",
    "1, Quality is good, it is a killer, price is reasonable, it is worth more than the price.",
    "2, solid, enough material, welding point is firm, surface treatment is appropriate, color is good.",
    "3, logistics is a hardship, the order of number 3 was received on number 11.",
    "4, if Amazon had marked the estimated delivery date as February 7th, I might have been satisfied.",
    "5, but if the expected delivery time is marked, it is equivalent to a commitment to the user, and when the commitment cannot be fulfilled, the user is very difficult.",
    "6. If you don't have the assurance to make a promise, please don't make a promise.",
    "7, actually, I care a lot about the commitment of the seller.",
    "8, so I got a low score.",
    "The gold line will fall",
    "The effect is still there, but whether it is obvious or not depends on the individual or the psychological effect.",
    "One thing that's not so good is the gold line, which was designed to look good, but in reality, this gold line will fall off, and if you put it on the car, and you touch it a few times, your hands and the car will be covered in gold dust.",
    "Hopefully future versions of these products will be better in that regard.",
    "This rectangular one has no decoration effect, so don't put gold lines on it, and it will fall off and make a mess on the car.",
    "The item is fine, speedy, 2 parcels, different packaging",
    "8 days is pretty fast, but it\u2019s only 2 packages, and the packaging is different, obviously one is more shockproof, with thick cardboard and layers of plastic, and the outer packaging is also easy to remove, it\u2019s like a domestic courier box, with a few airbags it\u2019s fine, it feels a bit sloppy.",
    "The bedding is really good.",
    "The 34cm mattress is not as thick as the usual one, you don't need to sleep directly on the mattress.",
    "Quality is good, both sides are soft, sleep is comfortable, I fell asleep quickly after laying on it.",
    "The mattress was delivered and there were some stains on it due to the violent delivery, but the customer service at Yalan was responsible and efficient in contacting me to solve the problem.",
    "Amazon is not selling its own products, it's shameless",
    "The page clearly indicates self-owned, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and problems are handled by contacting the supplier.",
    "I want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transmitted to the supplier, and it cannot be canceled; I want to return and exchange the goods, sorry, Amazon has successfully applied for return and exchange, but no one will help you, and you need to contact the supplier to return the goods.",
    "What does Nima sell?",
    "The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not bear after-sales service, and the customer service actually said, \u201cI will contact the supplier for you\u201d, and even claimed that it was self-owned, it is too shameless, naked, and deceive consumers!",
    "the experience of depression",
    "The filter element I bought from another website before has a good filtering effect, and even if I use it for another day or two after 28 days, there is no water scale.",
    "Because the quality of the things I bought on Amazon has always been good, I thought I would buy it here this time. I bought the filter for the first time on Amazon, and I didn't feel good. Not only did it start to have water stains early, but there was also floating black carbon powder on the filter until the 28th day, and I didn't know whether to continue using it or throw it away, so it was very depressing.",
    "it's not as good as i thought it would be.",
    "Compared to the plug-in board I used before, the external workmanship is general, and the internal one has not been opened to see how it is, but I hope it is as described by the store, and whether each independent unit is electrified is lacking",
    "the packaging is damaged, and we will wait for a while to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer packaging is damaged pretty bad, the inner box looks new but the manual looks like it's not new, it was just renovated in September, it's in stock, I hope it won't be bad when it arrives, please explain why a few customers mentioned the packaging was damaged and you guys are still selling it, thank you!",
    "overall it's good, but there are some problems.",
    "I bought a LAICA water filter for the first time, and after reading a few reviews, I felt that LAICA was a good value, so I chose it. I received the goods and installed the filter according to the instructions. I tried it and felt that it was generally good, but when pouring water, it seemed that the original water would mix with the treated water from the mouth of the bottle (the original water tank was not tightly sealed).",
    "You must wait for all the water to pass through the filter before pouring it out!",
    "the image is incomplete.",
    "The picture does not show the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is one; this bead is made in Thailand, there is no place of origin, this is two; there is no indication of quality, this is three; when I bought it in the UK, there were clearly boxes for each item, here there is only one simple plastic bag, and there is no product",
    "Be careful when buying, especially if you buy things from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is great.",
    "I ordered two days ago and today I found out that the price was reduced by 40 yuan, and I spent a lot of time looking for customer service, and the customer service said that they could not refund the price difference, but they could reorder and return the goods.",
    "This kind of customer experience and service is really different from that of Taobao.",
    "It's okay, it's worth buying as a newbie",
    "It looks good, and it\u2019s better than the gold one, which I\u2019ve seen in the mall and costs several hundred, so it\u2019s not bad for the first time I\u2019ve played with a gold one.",
    "it's not bad",
    "The stuff is really good, I sent it to my girlfriend, but it was a bit unpleasant when I was not at home in the afternoon when the courier came, and the courier company directly put the parcel in the post office and did not send me a confirmation message, so I had to run twice.",
    "But baby is definitely not bad.",
    "It's worth buying",

    "You never initiated contact with this officer, you never knew her extension, you never had a direct line to her, it was always her contacting you.",
    "Tragically, I waited nearly 3 days and the agent contacted me, my phone left me for a while and I didn't get the agent's call.",
    "I waited for 2 hours and the agent never called me, so I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed them to call me back.",
    "4 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do about the coffee machine that I received as a defective product!",

    "I have been using 925-25, very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not bad, the design is very beautiful, the reason why I gave it four stars is that the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the pen a bit shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable than 85.",

    "I bought a blue one two years ago on JD.com. It was pretty good quality, no noise, and the bass was good. I\u2019ve had it for more than two years and it\u2019s broken, so I\u2019m planning to buy another one (Urbeats).",
    "I also looked at the purple one, which looks nice, but when I bought it and opened it today, I felt it was not right, with both loud and soft sounds.",
    "I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song, but after listening for half an hour, I found that the problem was serious, not only the tonal quality, but also the bass effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise, is it only this purple one that has this phenomenon? Or is the current headphone manufacturing technology really not good?",

    "3. The cover is thin, my transformer is still recessed, I had to open the box and use my hands to restore it, the cover and the front panel are loose.",

    "Nowadays, most people use switching power supplies, and this stupid transformer is estimated to weigh 4kg.",

    "the goods are good.",
    "First of all, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was reduced in price, bad reviews, it was still not bad, high price performance ratio, cpu and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games, heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little dim (a common problem with ips screens), the sound quality is not very good, the hard drive is not good (I recommend spending",
    "(I\u2019d like to add that when buying keyboard stickers, you should never buy them from a store called E Cool Digital Center, which is a part of a chain called E-Bao. They are slow to deliver, the quality is poor, and if there is a problem with the product, they won\u2019t refund or replace it. The boss is also rude, so I\u2019d like to expose them.)",
    "Goods are good, but the platform bureaucrats are still the same.",
    "The hard drive is very good, the price performance ratio is absolutely high, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, absolutely recommended to buy if you are not in a hurry to use and can tolerate logistics.",
    "But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still there, and has not improved since I swore to never use it a few years ago. You can never find out the actual status of your shipment, information is always a few weeks away, you can never complain, and it\u2019s just so bureaucratic!",
    "The goods have been received for a few days, the logistics information is still 10 days later, you will receive the goods!",
    "Logistics is not a heartwarming business.",
    "It was delivered like this, not only was the packaging crushed, but the electrical packaging was also open, and I don't know if the packaging was tampered with.",

    "I don't know if it's good to use or if there will be any problems in the short term, as the previous evaluation, the things sent out when out of stock are indeed not reliable!",
    "The experience is above average.",
    "It's pretty much top of the line electric, has a lot of different brushing modes, but I don't think many people change modes every day.",
    "I used it for half a year without any problems, I brushed it every day, and it crashed about once every week and a half.",
    "The brush head attachments are equally cheap on Amazon.",

    "Overall, a very successful purchase.",
    "there are counterfeits.",
    "I bought two bags last time, and they were two different versions, the words in the left and bottom corners of the packaging were green, but one of them was not, it was white words, and the cat ate it and got diarrhea.",
    "I don\u2019t know if the Amazon\u2019s source is fake or if the employee dropped the package.",
    "I will buy it again, and if it is still fake, I will find your relevant person to be responsible.",
    "It's a crossbar!",
    "Amazon picture shows it as diagonal, but it was sent to me as horizontal, is this a scam?",
    "it worked great.",
    "The point is that cats like to eat.",

    "Narrow, tight, pinched, and worn.",
    "Not recommended.",
    "1. UN is clarks most comfortable series, but this one is too bad.",
    "Update: Today I compared the old UN series insole (the insole was left in the shoe while the shoe was thrown away), and the material was much worse than before, the elasticity was not as good as before, and the breathability was not as good as before, and it was just fake soft.",
    "2. My heel is not high, the part of the heel is about 3 inches forward from the highest point of the heel.",
    "3. I bought three pairs of Clarks abroad, only one of them fits.",

    "Try rockport again, if that doesn\u2019t work you\u2019ll have to go to an ecco store.",
    "Second best, poor quality control",
    "First of all, it is worth mentioning that Prime International Purchasing Ups is very powerful, and the order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.",
    "The shoes are much nicer than the picture shows, and the leather feels good.",
    "A little bit bigger size, 25 inch length, 10.5 inch width, 7.5W, the shoes are a little bit loose, but I like to wear loose shoes, and I just put a pair of insoles.",
    "Secondly, the quality control of these shoes is really not to be believed. One of the soles is damaged, and the other has various scratches on the surface and a pinhole, and the rubber strip connecting the sole to the upper is misaligned, and it\u2019s obvious that they\u2019re trying to pass off second-rate shoes as first-rate!",
    "I regret it a little!",
    "I bought this for $280 from a sale, and this price is pretty good for Asics, of course, there are lower prices if you look at the reviews.",
    "Now let's talk about the shoes, the pros: the shoes are light, running is comfortable, and they fit well, and they don't fall apart.",
    "It's a high value but the downside is obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, and this time I bought 40.5, there is still about one thumb's length between the front of the shoe and my foot, but it doesn't affect anything.",
    "These shoes are very \"narrow\", although there is still a distance left in front, but it feels tight.",
    "Also, the shoes are probably not breathable and my feet feel hot.",
    "press your heels",
    "First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.",
    "My feet are standard, I wear uk7.5 running shoes, eu41.5, uk6.5 shoes, and I have bought a few pairs of Amazon\u2019s Love Walk, and they have never been uncomfortable, but these shoes are a size too big, and the length is obviously too long, but the shoes are too thick, and the heel is still very hard, and the shoes are very hard to wear.",
    "If your feet are not particularly thin, I would not recommend buying this.",
    "If you must buy, you can replace the insoles, but the original insoles look very high-end, which is a pity.",
    "Perfect shopping experience!",
    "I am very satisfied, I like it very much, Amazon overseas purchase is undoubtedly genuine, the quality is very good, the price is cheap, it is safe to buy, the after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer service attitude is very friendly and gentle, the problem is patient and efficient, it is perfect to solve the after-sales worry, the matching fast delivery is very convenient and reliable, the delivery master is very concerned about the customer",
    "Anyway, we all like shopping in Amazon overseas!",
    "Absolute crap!",
    "It's really hard to say anything about this agency and Amazon.",
    "Be careful buying electronics on Amazon in the future.",
    "Although it has been a long time, I still have to complain.",
    "I bought it in winter, and it was sold out in less than 200, and it was useless at home for a few months.",
    "I found that the spring was not working when I wanted to use it, and the manuals of both devices said that they supported each other, but then I found that it was a problem with the heart rate monitor, because I tried it with another device and it still didn't work.",
    "I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agent, who then asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.",
    "After almost half a month, the goods were sent back to me in the original packaging, even the courier box was the one I used to send it!",
    "No response, no follow up, no test results!",
    "For whatever you want, good or bad.",
    "I called and said that if it was sent back like this, it meant that the equipment was not a problem, which was good.",
    "But I still can't connect, and the agency replies: That's not their business.",
    "I'm not going to bother with you guys for 200 bucks.",
    "This is a serious case of misrepresentation.",
    "I'm very sorry, it's not the right size.",
    "The headband is very comfortable.",

    "Size Shipping",
    "The workmanship is good, but the logistics is too slow, all the shoes I bought before were delivered by DHL, but this time Apex is... I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low, and I feel that the quality is higher than NIKE ADIDAS?",
    "Actually, they are all the same, so I buy them online.",
    "Size: I am 176CM, 68KG, my shoulders are 180CM, I bought M, the hem is slightly long, other than that it fits me well, I see that there is a recommendation for S, do you think it is suitable for slim body or do you prefer tight clothes? I think the sweater is still loose.",
    "this size is okay.",
    "Waist 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before purchasing and was told that I should buy xxl, and then I looked at the comments and decided to buy L, and after receiving the package, I found that the size was just right, and I almost got cheated.",
    "The price of Double 11 is much more expensive than that of Black Friday.",
    "The quality of the clothes is very good.",
    "Z affordable goods problem is very troublesome!",
    "The order placed on the 18th was only received on the 25th, the snail speed from Guangzhou to Beijing!",

    "The child was not willing to return the item, thinking that it was not a big problem, but the accessory was a small part, and the child's grandfather could not find it in the nearby hardware stores!",
    "Grandpa finally gave it to me!",
    "Looks like I can't buy Z's discounted goods anymore!",
    "poor quality of toy processing",
    "Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, it is very difficult to install the bolt, which shows that the processing quality is not good, and I don\u2019t know how long it can be played, because it is a promise to the child, and it will not be returned.",
    "Other reviews say the install is easy, does that mean only the one I bought has an issue?",
    "it's just a normal video.",
    "Is it bad luck?",
    "The packaging is old; the workmanship is poor; the music is only one and only 8 seconds long and then repeats; the action is just shaking the bag and walking forward, no variation.",
    "This gun is of no money value.",
    "I need it urgently, so I can\u2019t return it.",
    "The toy quality is good, but the packaging is a bit bad",
    "I received the parcel yesterday, which was bought from Amazon, and it was marked as EMS delivery, and finally it was delivered by the courier of Tmall, how many bends did it turn? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?",
    "Then let's talk about the packaging, it's wrapped in a few layers of plastic film, there's no plastic bubble wrap inside, and when you open it, all the parts are in a box that's empty, luckily the toy quality is good, there are no broken parts, but there are too many parts, because it's not battery-powered, it often derails when pushed by hand, and it feels like the gap between",
    "good quality, good fun",
    "It's fun to play, the component accuracy is high, the workmanship is exquisite, and the quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.",

    "I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch had a verification time when it was received. They replied \"Yes\", since it did, why was the time so different, it must be that the watch was not accurate, simply put, it was a fake product, not what I said, it was obvious that the quality problem (the numbers were not displayed completely) was taken out to sell, was it junk.",
    "I contacted the seller, and they gave me a bunch of reasons, and also complained that I shouldn\u2019t have bought their stuff in the first place, and that kind of product, and kind of seller, and kind of after-sales service, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon again.",

    "It must be genuine, I checked the watch at the store, and it looks beautiful, the workmanship is exquisite, the materials are good, and it is also imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight, and it is not comparable to the so-called mechanical watches of three or four hundred, this is a real deal.",
    "The watch is very accurate, with a completely acceptable margin of error, and the watch comes with a jewelry certificate of authenticity. The 12 on the watch face is a real diamond, which is perfect for me to wear, and it looks great as a gift.",

    "the worst shopping experience ever",
    "On the night of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, so I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon Malaysia, which was in stock but not self-owned and did not increase the price (secretly happy), because it was not self-owned, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the estimated delivery date was September 27.",
    "My wife is not happy because she doesn't have a phone, so she called me at 6:30 in the morning to think about a solution, and then she went to JD.com to see if there was any stock, and there was, so she immediately ordered another one.",
    "I just bought it new and was thinking of canceling the Amazon order.",
    "Because the order was placed at midnight, it was impossible for the courier to come to pick up the package at dawn, so I called customer service at around 7:00 to cancel the order, and the customer service representative replied that the order had already been canceled and that I should wait for the notification message.",
    "Okay, I'll wait patiently, and when I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the status of not shipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to ask them to cancel the order as soon as possible, and the customer service replied that it was already OK.",
    "I checked my phone at 3 pm and saw that the order was still there, so I had to contact customer service again to confirm that I had already called three times, and I asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller that the package must not be shipped!",

    "I checked the order again on Monday and it showed that it had already been shipped, I was speechless.",

    "The order is still in the rejected state, and we are preparing to send it again!",
    "Doesn't Amazon automatically follow up?",
