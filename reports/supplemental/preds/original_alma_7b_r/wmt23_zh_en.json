    "Illicit drugs such as heroin are more closely linked to the more affluent regions of the world.",
    "Similarly, within each country, the prevalence of drug abuse among the affluent social classes is higher.",
    "However, the proportion of those with drug addiction symptoms is higher among people with a lower social and economic status.",
    "Data from a few countries indicates that there is a connection between harmful drug patterns and illnesses and low incomes.",
    "These patterns seem to be less common in more affluent social strata.",
    "The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis could exacerbate the risks faced by vulnerable groups, including drug users, in particular.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as unemployment rising, have always been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced hundreds of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to the further expansion of the drug market. The widespread outbreak of COVID-19 may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in the cultivation of illegal crops, or because of the reduced control capabilities of national regulatory authorities, or because of the increased number of people who may have to resort to criminal activities in an economic crisis.",
    "The related restrictions on the new coronavirus have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, and it is possible that maritime smuggling has increased as a result. The risk of interception at sea is low, and there are more smuggled goods at sea than in the air or on land.",
    "Recently, reports have surfaced that cocaine goods can be directly shipped from South America via sea routes to Europe.",
    "Complexity enhancement",
    "The appearance of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but new, potentially harmful, synthetic cannabinoids are increasing. The drug market is becoming more complex, with new threats emerging.",
    "In addition to cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.",
    "There are approximately 500 new active ingredients on the domestic markets of member countries each year.",
    "Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.",
    "Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "Among the total number of new psychoactive substances confirmed in 2014, the opioid-like new psychoactive substances account for only 2%, but this figure has increased to 9% by 2018.",
    "Many of the new psychoactive substances in the class of opioids are similar to fentanyl, and their effects and dangers have been proven. They have caused overdose deaths in North America, but also in other regions, but to a lesser extent.",
    "In North America, fenanyl is used as a cutting agent for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and is also used to produce counterfeit opioid medications.",
    "Some evidence suggests that Europe also has the injection of new psychoactive substances excitation drugs: A study of residues left behind in six European cities found that many of the syringes contained new psychoactive substances that produce an exciting effect.",
    "The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become a permanent feature in the weakest groups.",
    "Single-class new psychoactive substances have rarely formed a large market.",
    "However, evidence from Europe indicates that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem in marginalized groups such as the homeless and prisoners.",
    "Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.",
    "Controls on precursors to synthetic drugs have forced drug makers to innovate, and many chemicals used to synthesize amphetamine, methamphetamine, and \"speed\" have been placed under international control.",
    "Drug dealers and manufacturers are always looking for alternative substances, not only those with less stringent controls, but also specialized chemicals designed to circumvent controls, i.e. so-called \"precursors.\"",
    "Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on the manufacturers of precursor chemicals, who rely on them.",
    "Evidence from Mexico indicates that this is already a reality: According to a report, in March 2020, a shortage of methylamine precursors imported from East Asia led to a price increase for methylamine in Mexico and the United States.",
    "The market is ever-changing.",
    "Synthetic drugs have replaced opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.",
    "The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.",
    "The number of opioids intercepted by Russian federal authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for the use of synthetic opiates has decreased significantly.",
    "However, the market for stimulants seems to be growing increasingly vigorous.",
    "Evidence suggests that methylenedioxypyrophenone (MDPV) and various ketamines, including dextromethorphan and a-p-methylphenethyl ketone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.",
    "Russian authorities reported that the number of secret production sites for the manufacture of various illegal drugs recently uncovered has risen sharply, and in two years has increased by more than one hundredfold, reaching 152 sites in 2018.",
    "The markets for methylphenylisopropylamine in Afghanistan and Iraq have grown.",
    "The investigation into the importance of methylphenidate in Iraq, conducted as early as 2012, revealed its importance for medical personnel, prisons and other institutions.",
    "Crystalline methylphenidate has become another major concern besides fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine.",
    "A study conducted in 2015 further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that marijuana was harder to obtain than \"fenetyl\" or methylphenethylamine.",
    "Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methylphenidate processing points, and the Narcotics Bureau has expressed concern about the large import of fake methylphenidate products. Methylphenidate processing points use these products as precursors.",
    "In Afghanistan, the manufacture of methylphenidate appears to have begun in 2014.",
    "Since then, the seizure volume of methylphenidate has been steadily increasing.",
    "But the amount of seizures in the first half of 2019 was 657 kg\u2014an increase of more than 100% compared to the previous year.",
    "In other countries, large quantities of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized, which also indicates that the country's production is rapidly increasing.",
    "Policy changes and trends of change",
    "Most legalized areas for non-medical marijuana use show an upward trend in marijuana use.",
    "In Canada, Uruguay, and the United States, 11 regions allow the production of marijuana products for non-medical use.",
    "In most cannabis-legal jurisdictions, the use of cannabis has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical cannabis use.",
    "In the two US states where legislation was passed earliest, Colorado and Washington, the use of marijuana for non-medical purposes by adults has increased, especially in the past month and in cases where it is used daily or almost daily, exceeding the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that since 2011, marijuana use in Uruguay has increased, and last month it almost doubled.",
    "This indicates that the main reason for the increase is frequent and frequent use of marijuana.",
    "The short-term data from Canada also indicates that the legal market expanded during the period from 2018 to 2019 while usage also increased.",
    "However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products through illegal sources.",
    "The reason behind the sharp drop in the worldwide cannabis crop seizures is the legalization of marijuana?",
    "In 2018, the worldwide cannabis plant seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which has decreased by 84% in the past 10 years.",
    "By comparison, the seizure volume in other parts of the world during the same period was almost doubled. The seizure patterns indicate that the policy aimed at liberalizing the marijuana market has played a key role in the decline.",
    "The regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect, and it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances.",
    "Some countries that apply different regulatory regimes to new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates for new psychoactive substances.",
    "In other countries, after new psychoactive substances were introduced through national legislation, the use of these substances has decreased.",
    "Weakened groups face the harm from both legal and illegal drug markets in terms of pain management and palliative treatment, mainly in high-income countries. Painkillers based on opioid-type pharmaceuticals are unevenly distributed in different regions.",
    "In 2018, over 90% of all opioid medicines available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.",
    "Approximately 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.",
    "The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the world's population.",
    "According to estimates, the population of low- and middle-income countries makes up 88% of the world's population, but only 9% of the population consumes opioid drugs for medical purposes.",
    "Obtaining medicinal opioids is a challenge that is related to many factors, including legislation, culture, the healthcare system, and prescription practices.",
    "People who are poorer are at greater risk of developing drug abuse symptoms. Approximately 35.6 million people suffered from drug abuse symptoms in 2018.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug abuse and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, in which individual's adverse socioeconomic trajectories are not only associated with their situation at a given point in time, but also with the risk of drug abuse.",
    "Drug abuse symptoms also deepen social and economic disadvantages, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thus fostering a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to degrading attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, indigenous peoples and migrants, sexual minorities, people displaced due to armed conflict or disasters, and people living in rural areas may also be disproportionately affected by drug addiction symptoms, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.",
    "According to the disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) indicator for years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, the adverse effects of addiction on a wider range of societies have intensified over the past 10 years.",
    "Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life expectancy due to drug use increased by 17%.",
    "In the injecting drug users, the liver cancer-related disability adjusted life years caused by untreated hepatitis B is particularly high\u2014up to 40%.",
    "The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychotropic substances and violence.",
    "Limited data from around the world indicates that intoxication may be a major factor in murder.",
    "However, in violent incidents, alcohol seems to have a greater impact than drugs.",
    "Although drug abuse may lead to crime, in some cases, this link can partly be attributed to a variety of intermediary factors, such as social and economic disadvantages, as well as other types of adversity caused by individual risk factors, family environment, and peer pressure.",
    "The connection between drug dealing and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, including international drug trafficking, large-scale organized crime activities may be implemented without violence.",
    "In the short term, the level and prevalence of violence depends less on the number of shipments and more on certain changes in the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as the change in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and the enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.",
    "The latest trend",
    "Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful.",
    "According to estimates, 1.92 billion people used marijuana in 2018, making it the most widely used drug in the world.",
    "By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "However, the related risks of opioid drugs are often ignored due to their relatively low use.",
    "In the estimated 167,000 deaths in 2017 related to drug abuse, 66% were caused by these substances, and in the 210 million years of lost life attributed to disabilities or premature death caused by drug abuse, 50% were caused by these substances.",
    "The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the aggravation of the opioid crisis by ketamine is most significant; in North America, it is fentanyl. These regions have few commonalities in terms of economic, demographic, or drug use statistics, but they are all struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and inexpensive substances.",
    "In North America, the use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to an increase in the number of overdose deaths involving opioids over the past 20 years.",
    "In the 67,367 cases of excess deaths registered in the United States in 2018, 60% involved fentanyl.",
    "Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.",
    "Part of the reason for the overdose deaths caused by fentanyl in the illegal drug market is that the effects of fentanyl are unpredictable.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for veterinary-use Cumarine has grown significantly.",
    "In this area, the number of patients with the disease is increasing, and the patients who are being treated are using it more and more.",
    "In 2017, the global seizure of QUAMOX significantly increased, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "However, after a new law on controlling the use of antibiotics was passed in India in 2018, the global seizure volume dropped to 32 tons.",
    "The crisis in these two regions is caused by the production of simple products and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international supervision for compounds similar to quinine or its precursors.",
    "These substances are available in both the legal and illegal markets, which makes it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse. As a result, the crisis in these two locations has worsened.",
    "The use of stimulants is on the rise.",
    "The cocaine and methamphetamine markets are the mainstays of the stimulant industry, and both substances are being used more in their major markets.",
    "Approximately 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, because cocaine is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "About 27 million people used phenylpropanolamine in 2018, with methylphenylpropanolamine being the most commonly used phenylpropanolamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to the majority of indicators that we have access to, the use of methylphenidate in these two areas has been expanding over the past 20 years.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, and the use of one drug increases the use of the other, sometimes at the same time. This is to meet the needs of the same market.",
    "The risk of injecting drug users has increased due to the new coronavirus pneumonia.",
    "According to estimates, about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of the world's HIV infections were caused by injection drug use.",
    "More than 10 million people have contracted HIV through injections, and 5.5 million people have hepatitis B.",
    "In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug overdoses, of which half died from liver disease caused by hepatitis B, and treatment for hepatitis B in drug injectors is still lacking in most cases.",
    "The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to use alcohol or phenothiazines, which are easier to obtain, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.",
    "With some users switching to injections or more frequent injections, there may be more harmful ways of using the drug.",

    "In the early stages of live-streamed e-commerce, live-streaming rooms often used discounts to attract users, and price advantages seemed to be the only selling point at the time.",
    "In recent years, there have been many \"superstars\" with a high degree of influence, such as Layher Hong, Fan Jianxuan, and many lesser-known \"masters\" and merchants who have emerged in vertical specialized fields.

There may be subsequent adjustments (refer to the new non-agricultural employment of 36.4 million people in January 2022, down from 50.4 million people), which is not as strong as the data reflects",
    "From a structural perspective, the impact of layoffs on high-tech enterprises is still significant, but it is lower; the employment of high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care has rebounded sharply, and the data shows that there is still a labor shortage in the service industry.",

    "With continued improvements in inflation data, the Fed has been simultaneously maintaining the balance between the fragile inflation expectations of the market while continuing to shorten the pace of interest rate hikes, but the market has ignored the Fed's hawkish stance and expects the Fed to stop raising interest rates sooner than expected and also expects two interest rate cuts at the end of the year.",
    "Under the tight labor market supply and demand situation, and the unclear impact of contractionary policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hike at the end of the year is relatively reasonable.

    "This visit not only helps deepen the cooperation between Vietnam, Singapore, and Brunei in traditional areas such as politics, diplomacy, economy, security, defense, education and training, oil and gas, tourism, and civil exchanges, but also creates a framework for cooperation in new potential areas such as digital economy, green economy, energy transformation, innovation and creativity, smart cities, and sustainable development.",

    "During his visits to the two countries, Prime Minister Phan Minh Chinh arranged time to visit and listen to the thoughts and desires of the Vietnamese communities living in the two countries.",
    "In their meeting with the leaders of both countries, Pham Minh Chinh Prime Minister recommended that the authorities of both countries pay more attention to, and treat the local Vietnamese community fairly, thereby creating favorable conditions for the local society to contribute to the development of the relationship between the two countries and to cultivate the relationship between the two countries.",
    "All of these recommendations have been endorsed and supported by the leaders of both countries.",

    "What was the \"object\" that fell from the sky over Alaska?",
    "Confusing and mysterious, speculation abounds.",
    "The US military again used the US's most advanced stealth fighter jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying in the air over Alaska on Friday afternoon (February 10).",
    "The location where the plane was shot down is ten miles from the Alaskan coast.",
    "This is the second time in less than a week that US forces have shot down an airborne object.",
    "A Chinese spy balloon drifted over the United States for several days before being destroyed over the coastal area of South Carolina on Saturday.",
    "The Pentagon said that the second object that was shot down entered U.S. airspace for the first time on Thursday evening and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over the skies of Alaska's northeast, at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), about the size of a small car, and much smaller than the previously shot down Chinese spy balloon.",
    "The Pentagon also believes that there are no indications that this object is controllable.",
    "John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the White House National Security Council, said on Friday that although the details of the object flying in the high altitude were not clear, it \"constituted a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft.\"",
    "Kobe said that this object is different from the spy balloon found in the United States. It does not have a banner with the word \"effective payload\" hanging from it.",
    "\"We call it a 'thing' right now, and that's the best description we can give of it,\" Kobe said.",
    "President Biden received the advice of the Pentagon before issuing the order to shoot down the object, and he made his decision \"very carefully,\" Coburn added.",
    "The official description of this object from the US government can be roughly summarized as: it is about the size of a small car, it has no control panel, it has no suspension system, and its flying altitude is about 10,000 meters.",
    "However, these pieces of information cannot answer basic questions, such as what this object is and which country it belongs to, and what tasks it is performing.",
    "Currently, there are many analyses and guesses online that suggest that this may be another Chinese balloon.",
    "It may have come from the same Chinese balloon that invaded American airspace, or the Chinese balloon that was floating over South America, and they may have been carrying out some kind of mission at different locations.",
    "Some people also associate the \"object\" in Alaska with \"unidentified flying objects\" (UFOs).",
    "According to a report in the Weekly Standard, citing a tweet posted by former US Congressman Peter Meijer on Friday, \"I really hope that this unidentified flying object is a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO.\"",
    "The satire of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprisingly effective, but it's not worth sparking a galactic conflict, Maje said.",
    "Ms. Maye was posting this tweet shortly after Kobe confirmed the fall of the object in Alaska.",
    "According to Weekly News, more than just Maje suspects that this object is an UFO.",

    "Amazon's customer service is so hard to believe.",
    "I'm guessing very few people have seen this place, but I also want to say a little about it.",
    "The shirt we bought it as was a zippered cap, and the one we sent to me was a short-sleeved one.",
    "After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service and confirmed that there was still stock of the clothes. I requested a refund, and the customer service said they would take care of it, and then I saw that the product name had changed to a short-sleeved shirt, and it turned out that the link to the product had been removed.",
    "Then, the customer service informed us that we could either keep the goods and receive a certain amount of compensation, or return the goods.",
    "This is how Amazon handles it?",
    "It's really hard to believe, getting the wrong clothing is not my problem, as a consumer, I demand the products I should receive, and I haven't made any crazy demands, Amazon changed the name to \"out of stock,\" though.",
    "This is my first long review, and I hope it isn't my last.",
    "Unintelligible sleeves",
    "It's true that it's made of leather, but when you look closely, it has many fine cracks, so it's not clear whether it's real leather. The sleeves of this jacket are also very puzzling. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the cuffs, but they are usually only about 1-2 cm long. This jacket, however, is 5 cm long, which is more",
    "Buying clothes is easy, returning them is also easy.",
    "But when will I get my money back?",
    "The clothes are well made, but because of the small size, I had to return them, but it has been over a week since I returned them, and I still haven't received a refund?",
    "Furthermore, it is the worst shopping experience since buying from Amazon, where the buyer has to contact the Fulfilled By Amazon service, which has a poor reputation for honesty!",
    "But the store was still not bad, they actively cooperated with the urging of the courier to refund the money in time, but the work done by the Amazon Prime logistics company is really quite infuriating, it took about half a month to refund the money, this kind of cooperative partner is just dragging Amazon's legs, the work efficiency is poor, and there is no service awareness!",
    "This is more suitable for young people.",
    "It was a 99-second kill.",
    "The workmanship, color, and feel of the overalls are good, they are soft/thin enough, and don't have a coal oil smell.",
    "Regretfully, the fit is more suited to young people, as it is slim-fitting.",
    "3XL, waist belt 2 feet 5 inches, maximum stretch 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg, wearing waist belt a bit tight.",
    "It seems that there is no belt around the waist, and it is quite difficult to loosen the waistband a little.",
    "Wearing tight clothing is also uncomfortable.",
    "The color is not very bright, but it is very good.",
    "The price just went up by over 200, what's going on here?",
    "Amazon used the first time the cooperative daily express delivery service, the first delivery was not at home, later I contacted the courier to schedule delivery twice, but the courier did not deliver, so I had to return the goods, this damn courier has no honesty, I strongly recommend not to use the daily express delivery service of Amazon again.",
    "This time, I also returned a shirt that was sympathetic to my needs, and it cost me more than 100 yuan to buy it again.",
    "Amazon's self-owned products should not contain such items",
    "Buy when the product is on sale, it is not cheap, but the reviews are also very good.",
    "When I actually received the product, I was shocked. The product had large areas of wear and tear, and there were many other places where wear and tear had occurred. It was either a defective product or a used one, and I will upload a picture later.",
    "I applied for a refund, and the factory's people said it was due to transportation, which isn't just a guess, right?",
    "How could wear and tear occur inside a product?",
    "There are only two possibilities: either a faulty or a second-hand product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then took it back.",
    "Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but from my Amazon shopping record, I believe that such a product should not appear in Amazon's own-brand products. When customers choose Amazon's own-brand products, they do so in trust. Customer wins, we win. The customer's victory is our victory. Let's work together to improve this. Thank you.",
    "I have been using this product for less than a year and two E2s have already appeared. I don't know how to deal with it?",
    "I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but since March 2016, the receiver on the right side has often shown red E2s, which may be a problem with the transmitting module. This does not match the information on the Amazon website about the transmitting module being able to work continuously for seven years, and there is no after-sales service available on the Amazon website. I don't know what to do now?",
    "It's okay.",
    "The first purchase was a bad one.",
    "It doesn't feel like new.",
    "The labels on the box were torn off, and the labels on the body were also torn off.",
    "And it always goes blank.",
    "After that, it was better.",
    "Exchange is quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the field of view is not very wide, but it's enough for ordinary home use.",
    "The only downside is that there are no cards, and you have to buy them yourself. Also, there are phones that you bought on Amazon in the past.",
    "There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, but this time there weren't any. There was a sticker-like label that you could stick on the warranty card when you bought the phone, but this time there wasn't any.",
    "I'm confused about whether it's because the prices are cheap that I'm not getting anything.",
    "Wait for the supplier to respond.",
    "The packaging had no labels, so I called the supplier directly and told them that the product was authentic without any labels, and if I had any doubts, I could send it to the Johnson & Johnson company for inspection using the leftover materials. I also left my license plate number and phone number, promising to send me a text message to enter my information into the warranty card on the Johnson & Johnson website. I have not received any text messages to this",
    "I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.",
    "Second purchase.",
    "Amazon's own-brand products are still very reassuring.",
    "The oil change technician said that the oil is clear and that it is good oil. Indeed, it is.",
    "Because it was the second time I bought it.",
    "So I'm still very comfortable with it.",
    "The delivery service was fast, there were no picky spots on the packaging, and using this oil made the engine sound noticeably quieter.",
    "The price-to-performance ratio is good, and it is difficult to find synthetic oil below $200.",

    "The interests of buyers were seriously damaged due to the customer service problems of Amazon Japan (the 8cm-long lice shipped by 8c were 14cm long, and 14cm=2cm)",
    "Admit the mistake, but always find excuses and emphasize that the goods are third-party goods, so they cannot be subject to the third party.",
    "Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.",
    "I originally purchased the page size options of 7c, 8c, and 9c, and at the time I thought this was a trap. I called the Japanese-speaking customer service of E-commerce Japan to clarify that 8c is 8cm, but when the goods returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm. I feel that this is a deliberate trap set up to cheat Chinese consumers (according to Amazon's after",
    "The Chinese customer service team said: We are very sorry for causing you losses. We offer you two choices:",
    "You can return the item and the buyer will be responsible for all shipping costs.",
    "If you don't return the item, we will reimburse you 1,000 yen.",
    "I calculated the cost and the shoes were 4000 yen, which is equivalent to 200rmb, so I chose option 1, and I didn't have shoes, so I lost 200 yen.",
    "Choice 2: I have shoes, and they made up for me with 2000 yen, and I lost 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded it, we will seriously handle it, the next day we sent an email saying that I do not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and that's it.",
    "I proposed: when purchasing pages with confusing options such as 7c, 8c, and 9c, the Chinese customer service told me that the common Japanese phone numbers do not include c, similar to 140, but have you ever gone to other pages of the mushroom?",
    "There were mixed-code situations, where both the American and Japanese codes were used.",
    "And why do you put the 8cm in the middle between 7c and 9c, which is the smallest size, when it is supposed to be the smallest size.",
    "The Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese-language services, but we do not know whether you are returning to your country, so we do not cover the shipping costs for you.",
    "I don't understand this logic either. I'm Japanese, I need Chinese customer service, and Chinese living in Japan don't need it either. What's more, tourists visiting Japan don't have the time to make international long-distance calls, so the question arises: who needs to call Amazon's overseas shopping service in Chinese? It's only people like me who shop online in Japan.",
    "Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for the people who shop online from overseas?",
    "This time, I was not very satisfied with the purchase.",
    "This is the second time I have bought diapers from Amazon, and I once bought a box of them when my baby was two months old. I chose European-imported paper diapers, and the first time I bought them I was quite satisfied. My baby used one diaper all night long, and it really can satisfy 12 hours without changing a diaper.",
    "However, when I bought the L-type diapers this time, each box contained two packages that were individually packaged, which I felt were more flexible than the imported Pampers Pure Protection. After opening them, I noticed that the paper was more flexible, and there was a clear difference with Pampers Pure Protection. After using them on the baby, they were okay, and there was no urine leakage or any signs of rashes.",
    "However, when the second diaper came out, the baby's inner thighs immediately appeared with red rashes, and they have not yet disappeared.",
    "The quality of the two bags in the first box is different, isn't it?",
    "We won't be buying this again in the future!",
    "Hope that the transport protection of the package will be given due consideration.",
    "This is the worst packaging and transport I have ever seen when ordering online. There were no protective measures at all, no cushioning foam, protective packaging materials, or anything else.",
    "About a compressed box.",
    "And the soft jelly boxes inside were packaged in cardboard boxes, which were all opened and bent.",
    "Hope is genuine, and the quality is guaranteed. In the future, I won't dare to buy things from the Amazon anymore.",
    "Rather than paying a premium of 50% in China, it is better to have some insurance.",
    "The problem with product packaging for goods is that I have seen it discussed in reviews as early as 2016, and the situation has not changed much since then.",
    "Amazon does not really care about customer feedback at all, and the distance between it and domestic platforms such as JD.com and Tmall is too great.",
    "It's good looking, but there are a few minor regrets.",
    "The entire cup is a color I love very much, orange-red, although my son is a boy, I still think that orange-red and yellow go well together.",
    "Smaller than I imagined, but since it's supposed to be used outdoors, I can accept it.",
    "I tried it out at home last night and it didn't work. The distance between the straw and the cap is too close, because the straw is vertical and it's always necessary to put the bulge on the cap in your mouth to drink water. My son thinks this area could be improved.",
    "It seems that other brands' straw cups are designed in such a way that the straw is inclined, and that there is some logic to it. Children's stuff, after all, is all about safety and comfort.",
    "Lightweight and large capacity.",
    "I like that it's lightweight, has a big opening, but the two separate zippered compartments seem a bit excessive to me. I don't know what to put in them.",
    "After buying it, I found that there was another similar one from another brand in the overseas purchase section for less than two hundred yuan.",
    "Fake goods are particularly impressive.",
    "Amazon sells counterfeit goods, and I'm guilty of buying them too.",
    "Customer service said that because I used it, I can't return it, so I don't know if it's fake.",
    "Because of trust, we feel sad. After all, this is a cosmetic product. Go to a physical store and buy it, it's worth a little more.",
    "Because it is a flash sale, I didn't read the reviews. I have already submitted a complaint to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's work together to defend our rights.",
    "Did it break?",
    "Fake goods?",
    "It was a tragedy.",
    "I chose a delicate pores mask with the second sheet, but as soon as I opened it, a strange odor came out. I thought it was normal because I had never used this product before, and when I applied it to my face, I couldn't stand it. It was a very strong smell that I couldn't describe, and I immediately coughed it out. My eyes also hurt, and I cried. I took it off immediately and washed my face",
    "I don't believe in ghosts, but I opened another bottle of the same kind, which doesn't have that strong of a smell, and I'm currently applying it.",
    "The smell reminds me of a bit of the smell of low-quality hair spray from a salon.",
    "It is hard to imagine that the self-owned cosmetics of Amazon will also have to be avoided from now on?",
    "Scumbags, that's what you are.",
    "When the product was purchased at the time, the promotional page said that if you spent 99 yuan, you would receive the complete collection of \"Three Body\", but the gift was not included in the package. So I called the customer service department to ask them to show me the screenshot of the promotion page at the time of purchase. The problem is, who saves the webpage screenshot when they buy something? You need the customer to provide you with the evidence of your own promotion,",
    "After the experience, feel it",
    "When buying things on Amazon for the first time, I experienced several things, so I'll talk about my feelings when using the products. The first time was painless and did not have a strong odor, overall it was a very good experience, it took about 8 minutes to fall off after wiping it once, but there was a small amount of hair and dirt on the surface, so it wasn't noticeable, so overall it was a good experience. As",
    "Well, I think this thing is actually pretty good.",
    "Secondly, I ordered on the 27th, received the goods on the 12th, and the total delivery time was 15 days, or half a month. Amazon's delivery staff also have a good attitude.",
    "Third, don't believe what Amazon says about Black Friday anymore, order on Friday and get a discount of nearly 12 dollars after waiting for two days, which is equivalent to my total cost of 170 plus (including shipping and other fees). There is a feeling of raising the price for promotional activities.",
    "Customer service said that there was price fluctuation, and I paid attention to the price for 10 days and it was basically the same. The price fluctuation was not very big.",
    "Price affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with granules, and with a guaranteed return policy!",
    "The toothpaste with particles is just right, and the sensation of freshness is just right after brushing, and the teeth feel smooth. The quality is better than that of a certain second-hand store in Taiwan, and they say it's imported, but there are many things without Chinese labels. We don't know where they're sold.",
    "From now on, I will never buy used goods from Amazon.",
    "Here is a suggestion: sometimes, it is hard to upload a single photo in the Amazon app. I hope that the app can be improved a little bit! It will get better and better!",
    "Over the past few years, the service has become worse and worse, and there is no quality to speak of!",
    "Waste Excellent ignores customer needs when placing orders and delivers at special times from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm.",
    "Because there are elderly people in the family who are unable to move after surgery, only in the evening can it be convenient to receive mail.",
    "The result was delivered right at noon, 12 o'clock, without any prior notice.",
    "If the delivery time is what your courier staff want, why bother to pretend to be polite and ask the customer to choose a time?",
    "If one's logistics can't guarantee service, then there's no point in doing e-commerce!",
    "An elderly man with three wounds on his body had to get up from bed to open the door and collect his mail, and he had to pay for it with change!",
    "The order has a contact phone number!",
    "No one called to give a brief explanation either!",
    "The term \"complaint customer service\" used by Excellent Net refers to a group of people from other regions who pretend to be working there and handle your complaints in a superficial manner before giving you a so-called response.",
    "There will be no changes or compensation!",
    "I also had to put up with similar issues regarding the delivery time before, but this time I couldn't stand it! It was too much!",
    "When the new book was purchased, the pre-sale delivery was received, and the cover and back cover were reversed. This was clearly a quality issue. How could we just close our eyes and send the book to the customer like this?",
    "Negative comments won't get you any contact either.",
    "Over the past few years, Excellence has deteriorated to the point where there is no quality of service to speak of!",
    "I will no longer spend a cent on Excellence.",
    "The picture quality is simply unacceptable.",
    "As a title such as \"Old Maps Collection\", this book is simply unacceptable in terms of image selection, layout, and printing. Some images are even blurry to the point of being unrecognizable.",
    "Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small-scale illustration, it should be able to live up to the vast historical records left by our ancestors in the index!",
    "And, besides, many of the images can be obtained from related industry resources in a clear original format, so what is the difference between using such images to compile books and not using them?",
    "I regret the loss of such a scientific spirit.",
    "The words are not evaluated, but each family member has their own opinion.",
    "Two stars overall.",
    "When I read this book in high school, I was only interested in reading it for fun, with the idea that a book like this wouldn't be addictive, since I wasn't particularly attracted to the web novel genre in the past.",
    "Then...I fell into the pit.",
    "According to the plot, the whole book is rather light-hearted and pleasant. Even when Yue Xing was still in an online game, even though the guilds were constantly fighting each other, they were still not very heavy-handed because they were often saved by Ye Xuan Dog and Xu Xing.",
    "Regarding the competition part, I wrote about the change of the era and the alternation of old and new. Perhaps I am just too sentimental (or perhaps I am just too sensitive).",
    "I spent a lot of time studying this book in high school, but I couldn't stop reading it.",
    "The full-time depiction of characters and the emotional line has left a deep impression on readers. Some characters are only mentioned occasionally, but they still leave a lasting impression, like the main characters Ye Xiaohua, Su Mingyan, and Huang Shuotian. The characters who are not in the center of the story, such as Jiang Bochuan and Chu Yunxi, are also very popular. In a light novel about e-sports",
    "In terms of the emotional line, there is no general problem with the concubines and beauties of the palace in the web novel that is widely criticized, and the emotions of all the characters in the novel are the same: they all like Honor of Glory, and they all want to win in a proper way.",
    "There are no grand conspiracies, but everyone seems so simple and cute.",
    "Perhaps this is also why there are no unpleasant roles in full-time employment.",
    "Full-time IP is a lot, and this is thanks to that.",
    "Ignoring the phenomenon of web novels, All-Day Job is still a good book in its own right.",
    "He really does provide some passion and some inspiration.",
    "In April, full-time jobs were to be anime-ized.",
    "I've wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but because my wallet is always too thin, I haven't been able to make a decision. When I finally decided to buy them, I discovered that the TB site was full of counterfeit goods. In fact, the latest version of the full-time edition has just been released, and I like the cover artwork quite a bit, but I still plan to buy the older version first. So I",
    "I'll just briefly mention the situation with the goods.",
    "The fourth book does not have a cover, but it is a new book.",
    "The seventeenth book is sealed but has been opened, and the book feels very strange, like nothing else is hard.",
    "The 23rd and 17th books are the same as the 17th book, but they are harder and very old.",
    "The publishers of a few books seem to be different, e.g. #23 and #17 seem to be from the same publisher as #2 and #15, but not the others.",
    "In general, it was quite satisfactory, the 24-book box was quite large, and it was very satisfying.",
    "The lonely lion cubs",
    "When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as Lost Corner, but there are still a lot of words!",
    "I read it three times, and only then did I manage to finish the book for the little ones, a lion that can shoot, and a lion that loves fruit juice and soft sweets.",
    "When the lion ate the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable, modern city people are not very accepting of such arrangements where animals eat humans.",
    "After all, the little lion that succeeded in human society has lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human being.",
    "Finally, only the back of the little lion can be seen, and we don't know where he went.",
    "Maybe many years later, the image of the little lion will still be in the memory of the grown-up children, and will be remembered on some day without being planned, perhaps it will touch or inspire them.",
    "Highly cost-effective work collections",
    "1. Previously, we didn't know about TASCHEN. We recently bought a lot of their books, and the reason is that they are too strong. No matter what the subject is or how the books are made, they are excellent.",
    "This work has been published in three versions, the largest of which and the complete collection of Michelangelo's works are almost the same size, being about 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium-sized version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest and comes with a bookcase.",
    "I think it's still acceptable, first of all, because it's cheap, and the 700-plus pages are divided into two books, making it easier to read; secondly, it's different from the Michelangelo Complete Works, which is a large book, while the black-and-white hand-drawn drafts of Da Vinci take up most of the space, making it the best choice for readers with limited budgets and non-art profession",
    "The explanations of the drawing part are excellent, including a composition analysis, a draft analysis, and a historical background (such as the last supper), but it is unclear whether the printing or book size is the problem, some shadows are too dark, and the details are not clear. There is some regret.",
    "In comparison to Michelangelo's handwritten manuscripts, those of da Vinci are much more extensive.",
    "The former is already a genius, and the latter is so versatile and accomplished that it is hard to call him a genius.",
    "If previously, you could only experience half of Da Vinci through his paintings, after viewing the handwritten notes, you will be completely speechless.",

    "Overall satisfaction",
    "I was worried about the packaging of the camera when it was first released, but this time it was okay, there was an inflatable bag inside, the three digits matched, and it could be registered on the official website, and the shutter speed was zero. The rest was just a matter of waiting for time to verify it.",
    "The delivery speed is pretty fast, so here I'm going to complain about the delivery guy. He put the valuable items in the front room, and went away quickly. I couldn't open the package in front of him, so I couldn't check it for quality. I really don't know what to say about this.",
    "The merchants delivered the goods beforehand with the customers' interests in mind :)",
    "Merchants are more responsible, and they specifically call to ask about the size of the camera screen, which is very thoughtful for the customer.",
    "Delivery speed is also fast.",
    "The kinesiology tape is quite suitable and useful too.",
    "The battery is not fully charged.",
    "The machine is really good, I want to ask how it can't reach a full charge after the first time of charging? The charging indicator light is always red.",
    "There is no official Amazon feedback channel at the moment, so we can only give feedback on the product ratings.",
    "1. On March 29, I pre-ordered the book for 31 yuan, which will be sent to my device on March 31. At this time, the book is not available for preview on Amazon's official website (because it has not been published yet);",
    "The book sent to devices on March 31st was blank, with only the message, \"Please stay tuned,\" and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced in price to 18 yuan;",
    "Over the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank books downloaded to my device, then sync them again, but I have not been able to obtain the electronic version of \"The Essence of Business\" containing actual content, but I have seen that Amazon's official website can preview the book.",
    "Currently, I have a few thoughts:",
    "1. The issue of price is not the most important one. The key is how to replace the blank books on the Kindle with books with actual content, rather than downloading them and then being told \"please wait.\"",
    "After pre-ordering the book, you probably won't buy it again, after all, if it's delayed, it's quite complicated to download a book with no content;",
    "3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues, so that when downloading electronic books or using them with questions, it can be reported (via tickets, online customer service, etc., which can be referenced from the official Microsoft Store).",
    "It is not recommended to read it.",
    "I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see a review of it on memory.",
    "This book is not a short story collection, but rather a collection of fragments from everyday life about love.",
    "The tone of the book is extremely flat, it's the kind of flatness that is like white water, the use of words and phrases is perfect for minimalism, and the plot is as calm and quiet as the streets in the afternoon of a summer day.",
    "Every short story is a fragment of time from everyday life, without a beginning or an end.",
    "They are collected together under the title \"When We Talk About Love, What Are We Talking About?\"",
    "I think this short story collection, and its title, are a form of behavioral art. The author is trying to express that love is not limited to the ups and downs of life on the stage, the legendary sea and the desert, or the sticky-sweetness of love. Love is not limited to the above, and it should not be represented by the above. Love is also a boring, everyday life. It is a life that is devoid of flav",
    "While reading this book, you may recall your neighbor's quarreling couple, your acquaintances' stale marriages, and the unpleasant feelings of your relationships.",
    "This is exactly why I do not recommend reading it: from an aesthetic point of view, the book's style and plot are bland and boring, unless you are living a turbulent life or your life is like living in a castle of sweets. Otherwise, you will feel that the book is weird and boring to read.",
    "From a philosophical perspective, everyday events do not make one's eyes light up or broaden one's perspective (unlike in Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and brief segments do not discuss any issues, such as what mistakes lead to the failure of love?",
    "What are the reasons for the breakup of the main character's marriage?",
    "Therefore, I do not recommend reading this book. It does not matter whether or not you read it.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and style than through the plot, which is one of the reasons why the reading experience of this book is inferior.",
    "Suitable for quick reading, but not for close examination.",
    "This book is logically sound, but its content is not enough.",
    "They explain what many sales theories are about and why, but they are weak in terms of how to do it, just pointing out the direction but not giving specific methods.",
    "This book also feels like it was compiled.",
    "There are both domestic and foreign examples; there are both famous entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people who are not well known.",
    "Whether this story was compiled as an example is not known. If some cases the author experienced were used, it would be more convincing.",
    "The customer-client designation goes back and forth in terms.",
    "In the title, the customer is still the customer, but in the main text, the customer becomes the client.",
    "There were also problems with missing punctuation marks, misplaced numbers, and erroneous page numbers in the electronic book.",
    "In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not very suitable for people who are already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales performance.",
    "A quick introduction to Internet finance",
    "This book is quite shallow, and can be said to be an introduction course. It can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, one still needs to dig in by oneself.",
    "Moreover, the book was written earlier, and the later content of the WeChat and Weibo subsidies to promote user habits has not been mentioned. Today, the third-party payment share is probably not as small as the proportion mentioned in the book, right?",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat and just bring their phones with them. And because of the high bank balance due to the use of UnionPay, many merchants have abandoned it.",
    "But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this beginner's book. It is clear that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the development history of both domestic and foreign finance. This is why the content is so easy to understand.",
    "Writing in a high, wide space is easy, but it's difficult to write in a way that is understandable to everyone.",
    "I appreciate you, and I want you to know!",
    "The first factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the amount of pay, but whether they feel sufficiently appreciated and valued in their work.",
    "According to Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs, after the basic needs for survival have been met, the most urgent need is for the fulfillment of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, recognized, and appreciated.",
    "Indeed, for most Chinese people, it is \"hard to say I love you from the heart,\" even when they feel love, gratitude, and praise. They keep these feelings to themselves and don't express them.",
    "The author explains five languages of praise in this book: positive words, thoughtful gestures, service, thoughtful gifts, and physical contact.",
    "I think the important thing is not so much that you know what the five languages of praise are, but that you can spontaneously and genuinely use these five languages to praise and thank the people around you, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues.",
    "In fact, the more intimate the relationship, the more praise and gratitude we need. Only then will our lives become more beautiful.",
    "Businesses can also retain talent to a certain extent by praising them. This will also help reduce the rate of resignations.",
    "We are grateful to translators for bringing us the interesting ideas and worlds from foreign countries.",
    "Due to cultural differences between the West and the East, and other reasons, there may be some differences between the languages, and if you have the opportunity to read the original text, I believe you will gain more.",
    "Thanks again to the authors and translators, and to the editors for their hard work!",
    "Amazon should strictly review this product, which is suspected to be counterfeit.",
    "The quality is abysmal, the packaging is falling apart, there is no weight, it is even worse than street food, there is no weight, there is no barcode, and the 10-pack is also falling apart, it is completely unacceptable as a quality product; this is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, and I have already requested a refund; this is purely a quality issue; I advise the merchant to be careful and not to accept inferior products",
    "Amazon should take care to ensure that all products are of the highest quality.",
    "The products are careless and there is a difference between the expectations and the reality.",
    "Advantages:",
    "1. Large brands, cheap prices.",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are both from PANASONIC, and they work fine, but they are not up to my expectations.",
    "Disadvantages:",
    "1. There is no indicator light, which means that the basic power indicator has been eliminated. I imagine that customers who bought the product for 300 yuan are considered to be stingy in the eyes of Panasonic (PANASONIC). This is an act of disrespect.",
    "2. There is a strong odor. Even if you only charge it for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong odor of plastic burning.",
    "The office tried out the plastic for one day, and the whole house smelled of that plastic smell.",
    "",
    "Small packages",
    "Receiving the parcel, I could tell that I had fallen into a trap when I saw that it was written on the top that it was an e-commerce version. It was smaller than what I bought in the supermarket, and it should be M. The packaging is different from that on the product description, so it must be the new version.",
    "Three stars is for being careless and not paying attention to the product specifications. You selling M size to me is fine, but if you are selling a fake product, that's not okay?",
    "Online shopping is very complicated, so if you have the time, you should go to the supermarket and buy there.",
    "Just the vinegar.",
    "I don't like the taste.",
    "Children do not like the taste of toothpaste, and every time they say it's spicy. Perhaps a more accurate term would be better to describe it, but for now, that's the only word children have in their vocabulary.",
    "I bought it during the event and it was quite cheap, so I don't feel like giving it a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.",
    "This is the real thing, packaged well.",
    "The packaging is very complete, and it has a blow-up bag inside. There are no online reviews for products that only show the appearance of one product.",
    "The outer packaging of the bottle also has a layer of plastic film, just like the picture describes, and the delivery was also very fast. The second day after taking the picture, the delivery arrived.",
    "It is the real thing, but there is none in stock. We don't know when it will be restocked.",
    "A bad shopping experience.",
    "During Black Friday, I placed an order, but it took a long time to receive it, and when I checked the status later, it turned out that the package had already been delivered. I asked my colleagues, but they said they hadn't helped deliver it. I contacted the courier company, but they said it was up to the sender to initiate the query, so I contacted Amazon customer service. It took more than 10 days to find out that the package",
    "Wrongly inserted images",
    "I thought I would be able to receive a pair of headphones like those in Figure 1, but I received a pair like those in Figure 2 instead. It's fine that the pictures don't match, but what does it mean that the left and right sides of the headphones have different volumes?",
    "Although the names are the same, we still hope that everyone will be careful and pay attention, and we also ask the Amazon management to replace the correct images as soon as possible. We are very grateful.",
    "The operating system is generally good.",
    "After using it for a while, in general, the picture quality is still okay, you don't feel any difference, but this system makes you feel confused, booting up takes longer than usual, and it's difficult to make good settings, and the software that comes with it is not worth commenting on, the response speed is also quite average when compared to that of a colleague's, and that's not a matter of quantity.",
    "According to the reviews, the design is said to be very user-friendly. I couldn't find any place that is user-friendly. The design of the remote control buttons, which are commonly used, in the up, down, left, and right directions, and the return key position is really unimpressive.",
    "So, let's just treat it as a TV and add a TV box or something like that.",
    "The price reduction is too great.",
    "The price reduction is too good! From 100+ yuan to 99!",
    "Amazon has accumulated a lot of unrated orders, so I used a copy of a single sentence as a rating content.",
    "If I rate this product using this sentence, it means that this product has at least an 85.",
    "For poor products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers can use them as a reference when buying, and merchants will also improve the quality of their products based on this.",
    "Low-priced good lines, that's enough for me!",
    "This line is so cheap, but it should meet the HDMI certification standards. After comparing it with the overpriced junk in China's Akihabara, I can say that it is thicker and more flexible than the original, and the transmission without noise is up to 7 meters. From now on, I will only buy low-priced lines from Baisi!",
    "The service is fine, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than on other sites.",
    "After placing the order, I discovered that I had made a mistake, but the cancellation of the order could not be undone. The link to the online customer service was always displayed as an error, and I could not contact them.",
    "After the goods arrived, the delivery man called me and I said I didn't want them, but I couldn't cancel the order. The delivery man took them back and said he would sign for them first, and then I could request a refund.",
    "It was only when applying for a refund that we were informed that food items once delivered cannot be returned, and that it is also the same policy to say that once delivered, they cannot be returned.",
    "I have previously bought items that cannot be returned on Amazon and JD.com, including milk and diapers, and contacted customer service to have them returned. I even had a diaper from Amazon that smelled too strongly to be returned after opening it, and the customer service team still gave me a refund. However, when you order on Amazon, you cannot get a refund.",
    "Rules are dead, people are alive, how do you handle it? Contact your customer service department.",
    "Tell me either that I should take it myself, or that the delivery person should buy it themselves, which is already not an easy task for them. Why should I make them pay for something that isn't even theirs to begin with?",
    "Okay, I'm not going to back down either. I took it myself, but I must give you a 1 for service.",
    "Please don't waste money.",
    "First, I was full of anticipation to buy the products, and I thought that the Dali brand would not be bad, so I received them and found that they were still okay, and their size was also good, but there was one box that was basically all soft, and it was difficult to tell from the outside. It required a sense of touch, and when I tasted it, there was no flavor at all, it was faint and tasteless, and the flesh was",
    "Eat a piece of fruit and you will become one step smarter! From now on, you will never buy fruits on the Internet again!",
    "Where can I find the product anti-counterfeiting labels?",
    "The corner of the bottle that is depressed is impressive, and it must have been caused by a strong impact. From the outside packaging bag, it feels like the degree of damage is very disturbing, after all, it is a packaging for food products, and it is also an international purchase. There is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark, and opening the bottle is very easy, the key is that the honey on the inside comes out directly, and there",
    "I don't quite understand it, having been born in China.",
    "It should be the real thing, right?",
    "There was also a message that said something like \"20th number to come,\" which was sent to me on the 14th. This was my first time ordering from here abroad, and I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal?",
    "Delivery service needs improvement.",
    "I bought a total of 5 delivery vouchers, and when I picked them up, I made an appointment for 3 at the first time, but only 2 were delivered, and it took a lot of back and forth communication to confirm that it was a delivery error and that they would send the missing ones; at the second time, I just happened to pick a day off, and the website and WeChat did not indicate that you need to make an appointment during working hours,",
    "Good shopping.",
    "The reviews are excellent!",
    "I still prefer Amazon's self-owned products. After ordering abroad, it's very convenient to bring it back from abroad. The logistics time to bring it back from abroad is also just a few days longer than from China. It has to be said that Amazon's ability to clear customs when importing from abroad is very strong. It is much faster than going through a transshipment. So now many things are ordered abroad and brought back to China.",
    "I hope that the quality and prices of domestic goods can be better, and many things are made in China, but when you go out and buy them back, they are cheaper than they are in China, so I hope they can improve.",
    "Garbage",
    "Do you think this package looks like garbage on the side of the road? Please ask yourselves this question.",
    "A plastic-breakable packaging is shipped from Germany in a plastic bag. Is this packaging responsible?",
    "I think that this packaging is the same as that for trash, and that purchasing this product comes with packaging that is crude and has no measures to prevent damage. There is just a simple plastic bag to wrap it in, and the packaging becomes completely deformed after receiving it, and the contents inside have also been damaged.",
    "If I only met one of them, I recognized it, bought a few of them, and contacted Amazon customer service. The customer service said it could be returned, but I had to pay the shipping fee, and the shipping fee would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I ask you a question: when I pay the shipping fee with cash, you give me a gift card, which is just asking me to buy your gift card myself, and I also have to mail the product to the German warehouse, which is not buying a product just to be disappointed!",
    "I have been telling the customer service department that the responsibility for this kind of problem lies with them, but they will not admit it even halfway. They will not even take responsibility for a half a sentence. What kind of after-sales service is there to protect consumers when there is no one willing to take responsibility? One word: fail! I estimate that Amazon will not give me the opportunity to publish my review. They will simply delete it!",
    "Quality is very good, but logistics are poor.",
    "The quality is very good, it's a must-kill, the price is reasonable, and it's worth it.",
    "2, solid, well-made, welding points strong, surface treatment appropriate, colors very good.",
    "Logistics is a hardship; the 3rd single is delivered on the 11th.",
    "If Amazon had indicated that the estimated delivery date was February 7th, I might have been very satisfied.",
    "However, if the delivery date is indicated, it is essentially a promise to the user, and when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is likely to be unhappy.",
    "If you don't have a handle on the promise you are making, don't make a promise.",
    "In fact, I really care about the commitments made by the merchants.",
    "Therefore, I got a low score.",
    "The gold wire will turn black.",
    "The effect is still there, but whether it is obvious or not depends on the individual. Or it could be a psychological effect.",
    "One thing that's not so good about it is the gold thread. Originally, it was designed to look good, but in reality, the gold thread will tarnish. If you put it on the car, you'll notice some gold dust on your hands and on the car after a few moves.",
    "I hope the product can be improved.",
    "This square-shaped one has no decorative effect either, so don't bother to put gold wire on it. If it falls off on the car, it will be a hassle to clean the car.",
    "The goods are in good condition, the speed is fine, and they are packed in two packages, but they are not packed the same way.",
    "The delivery speed was pretty fast, but it took two packages in two separate boxes, and the packaging was different, too. One was too much for shock absorption, with thick cardboard attached and covered with a layer of plastic. The outer packaging was also convenient to open, like a courier box, and it was enough to put a few air cushions inside. It felt like a bit of a rush job.",
    "Yarana mattress is really good.",
    "The 34cm mattress is not an ordinary thickness, and you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.",
    "The quality is very good, whether it is the front or the back, it is very soft. Sleeping on it is very comfortable. After lying on it for a short time, you will fall asleep.",
    "The mattress arrived with some stains, which were caused by violent transportation by courier. Yalan's customer service was very responsible and very efficient in solving the problem.",
    "It is not a self-owned product, Amazon is shameless.",
    "The page clearly indicates self-service, but in fact the goods are delivered by the supplier, and after-sales service is provided by the supplier. In case of problems, contact the supplier directly.",
    "To cancel an order, I'm sorry, the order information has been sent to the supplier, and we cannot cancel it; to return or exchange a product, Amazon has successfully applied for return and exchange, but I'm sorry, no one is going to help you, you need to contact the supplier directly to return the product.",
    "This Nima is some kind of self-owned product.",
    "The products are not from Amazon, and Amazon does not provide after-sales service. Customer service actually said, \"I will contact the supplier for you,\" and claimed that it is a self-operated store, which is too shameless! It is an open lie and deception of consumers!",
    "The experience of gloominess",
    "Previously, the filters I bought online from other places worked well to filter the water. After 28 days, I continued to use them for another 1-2 days without any water stains.",
    "Since the quality of things purchased on Amazon has always been good, this time I thought of buying them here. This is the first time I have bought a filter on Amazon, and I feel that it is not very good. Not only did it start to have water spots early on, but the filter also lasted until the 28th day, and there were suspended black carbon powder in it. I really don't know whether to continue using it or throw it away",
    "It wasn't as good as I imagined it to be.",
    "Compared to the plug-in boards I have used in the past, the exterior workmanship is generally poor, but how it looks inside has not been opened up yet. However, I hope that, from the perspective of convenience of use, each independent unit is electrically connected and that this is described by the shopkeeper.",
    "The packaging is damaged, so wait for a certain amount of time to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer packaging is damaged quite badly, but the inner packaging box looks like it's new, but the manual doesn't seem to be new. The store was renovated in September, and we were stocking up. We hope it won't be bad when we receive it, and we'd like to know why several customers have mentioned the packaging being damaged, but you've been able to handle it all without any problems. Thank you!",
    "Overall, it's not bad, but there are some minor problems.",
    "The first time I bought a water filter bottle, I read a few reviews and felt that LAICA had a better value-for-money, so I chose this one. I installed the filter cartridge according to the instructions, and tested it out for a while. In general, it felt fine, but during the process of pouring water, it seemed like the original water and the filtered water mixed together (the original water reservoir was not very airtight).",
    "Always wait until all the water has been filtered before pouring it out!",
    "The image is incomplete.",
    "The picture did not capture the details of the side, the details of the side were not consistent with the style of the main body, there was a great difference, this is one; this bead is from Thailand, but it is not marked with the place of origin, this is two; there is no indication of the material, this is three; when I bought it in the UK, it was clearly marked with a box for each item, but here there is only a simple pl",
    "Be careful when you buy, especially when you buy things from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is terrible.",
    "Two days ago, I placed an order and today I received it, and found that it had been reduced by 40 yuan. It took me a long time to find the customer service, and the customer service said that they could not refund the difference. I could either buy it again or return it.",
    "This customer experience and service is a million times better than Taobao or Tmall.",
    "It's not bad, as a beginner, it's worth buying.",
    "The quality is acceptable, and there is no comparison with the top-grade Kumamoto, which I saw in the mall before. It is at least several hundred yuan, and I am quite satisfied with this one. This is my first time playing with Kumamoto, and it is okay.",
    "The quality is good.",
    "The service is really good, it was sent to my girlfriend, but in the middle of the day when Canada Post was not open, I had some unpleasant experiences. They just left the mail in the mailbox and didn't send a verification text message that I picked up the package. I had to run two times.",
    "However, the baby is really good.",
    "Worth buying.",
    "The little monkey is cute, and the Amazon discounts are really big. The official website of Chow Sang Sang directly ships the goods, and I ordered last night and received them today afternoon. This is really fast.",
    "The postal and courier workers are also very responsible.",
    "Bravo!",
    "One customer's ad",
    "When you receive this defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you within 54 hours or so.",
    "Then in the middle, you contact the customer service staff, and they will tell you that this issue will be handled by a specialist, and they will inform you of the outcome.",
    "You will never be able to contact this specialist, you don't know her ID number, and you don't have a direct dialing number. You can only contact her if she contacts you, not the other way around.",
    "The tragedy is that I waited for nearly 3 days, and the specialist contacted me. My phone was away for a while, and I did not receive a call from the specialist.",
    "I waited for two hours without receiving a call from the specialist, during which time I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email requesting that the customer service representative call me.",
    "Four days have passed since I received the Amazon defective coffee machine, and I still don't know what the final result will be!",
    "Amazon's products in the US are fine, but international shopping is a good thing, but the service provided by US Amazon is far inferior to that of Amazon.com.",
    "For me, I can only keep waiting...",
    "Uneven floor",
    "Because the review points are all very good, we are all very excited about this pot. When we got it, we liked it very much, it was very lightweight, but when we used it, we found a problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it is raised in the middle, and the sides are hollowed out, and the oil has run to the sides. We bought it specifically to fry meat, but it is not possible to cover the central area with",
    "Whether my luck was bad or not, I just happened to get a pot with a very uneven bottom. Fortunately, Amazon provides a month's return service, so I decided to return it.",
    "I wiped the pan clean with a rag, and wasted half a day.",
    "Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve it.",
    "This is a very simple-looking product, with a very clean design style.",
    "The shape of the cube is designed to have a slight curved top.",
    "Originally, the lines should have been very smooth.",
    "Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.",
    "Because there are two components at the top, the front one is the control panel, and the back one is the water tank lid.",
    "The curvature of the lid and the curvature of the control panel are not consistent, and there is a height difference of about 2 mm after they are joined together.",
    "Although it looks like a very small gap.",
    "However, it can be said that it completely destroyed the entire design feel.",
    "I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.",
    "It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet capable of creating products of such a high standard.",
    "Of course, feedback from the after-sales lady cannot be too high for the product, but when I heard the after-sales say that all the individual products are like this, and not just mine, which has problems, her disbelieving and honestly apologetic attitude made me realize that beauty cannot be too high either. 2019-7-7: The pump is malfunctioning and the water output is low. It has been repaired twice already",
    "After the discount, it was very reasonable, and Amazon's fake discount made me sad.",
    "The insulation is very strong and the baby is born one week after purchase.",
    "There is no heat sensation on the outside of the pot, so it is safe to touch even when it is hot and can effectively prevent heat from escaping.",
    "Even after a night in an air-conditioned room, the temperature remains high.",
    "Amazon announced the 320th anniversary event with great discounts, but later discovered that everyone had received the same 249,289,299 discounts. We felt deceived at first, but after comparing it with the prices of other brands in the supermarket, we found that it was still more economical than the same price range. From now on, we can take it with us when we go out.",
    "Vitamix 6300",
    "I've been waiting for a long time, and when I saw that the Meiyashop 6300 was on sale, I bought it from Zhongya's overseas shopping site at the same price. I better get it while it's hot.",
    "Ordered on September 2nd and expected delivery was on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, which was about 10 days earlier than expected! The speed is really fast!",
    "The packaging is not very large, and the original packaging of Vitamix is used directly. Amazon is not afraid of the Vitamix breaking down after being transported across the ocean!",
    "The machine looks new and the parts are complete, but the cup on the base is so shaky that I'm afraid it will fly out when I turn it on!",
    "I asked a friend who has 5200, and he said it wasn't as loose as mine.",
    "The recipes included in the book are all in English, which is quite exhausting, and there is no Chinese version available online either, which is a real bummer!",
    "After receiving the goods, I bought a transformer as soon as possible. I guess it will arrive in about 3 days, so we can have a good go at it then!",
    "Too small, no umbrella cover, and the material is generally poor.",
    "It's not even a big deal!",
    "The second Totes, 1. No umbrella cover 2. The umbrella handle is generally made of ordinary material 3. It's written Large, but it's actually a convenient umbrella that can be used by one person. Two people using it would probably be enough.",
    "On the contrary, the one I bought before in Myanmar can fit three people without any pressure.",
    "It doesn't feel good.",
    "First of all, the box is not very sturdy; just a little push and it deforms. Second, the back design is not effective in preventing scratches to the ABS on the box surface when it is laid flat; third, the inner part of the box is just a place where a piece of cloth is wrapped around and the handle sticks out; and so on, there are various displeasures. Finally, the zipper is not very smooth.",
    "The wheels really are quite good.",
    "It can also be done",
    "The advantages are that this shoulder bag is more refined and looks durable.",
    "Disadvantages: the barcode on the card cannot be scanned (what the heck is going on?), the 15.6-inch laptop does not fit (can it be any longer?), and the shoulder strap can be locked, but it does not come with a lock, which is not very customer-friendly.",
    "The overall quality is good, but I don't know if it's real leather.",
    "The overall feeling is alright, I don't know whether it is real leather, so I can't make a judgment without knowing it.",
    "You can fit A4-sized documents, but I doubt you can fit in thick and hard box-shaped objects (that cannot bend) that are more than 80 pages thick.",
    "The bag is very soft, and the inner compartments are also divided more humanely, which is quite good.",
    "I got this bottom with a small sand hole in it, I don't know if it's because of my character or what?",
    "I was too lazy to return the items and just endured it.",
    "Overall, it's worth a four-star rating.",
    "ForRoyal is popular all over the world for its camera strap and single-lens reflex strap.",
    "This sling is designed more scientifically, it can be hung on both shoulders, is practical and protects the camera in the chest with soft materials, unlike other quick-draw shooters who use screws to fix the camera at the bottom, and it is also very easy to take the camera off.",
    "Waste disposal",
    "I bought my violin a half month ago, and it's missing a part. After informing Amazon, I was given the customer service phone number, and after several communications, the part has not yet been received. What kind of efficiency is this?",
    "It is estimated that after the problem is fixed, maintenance will be more troublesome. So, let's just avoid it, it's too time-consuming!",
    "It has minor flaws and the sound is not bad.",
    "The headstock is defective, missing one corner, it feels like a second-hand instrument, and there are no freebies either, but the price is already quite reasonable for this instrument, and the sound is not bad either.",
    "It's ok, the first menu is ready.",
    "After using it for a long time, the only problem is that the bass is hard to come out. Overall, it's not bad.",
    "The craftsmanship isn't as perfect as it seems.",
    "When I bought it for the first time, the product had problems and all the lights were flashing, making it impossible to use.",
    "After requesting a refund, it's been three days since the goods arrived in Shanghai, and they still haven't been delivered.",
    "I don't answer phone calls for delivery either.",
    "The courier company says that they only have that contact method.",
    "Amazon does not have a place to file complaints.",
    "There was no request for it, but in the absence of a delivery date, the delivery was unexpectedly delayed - this was the text I received.",
    "Then they talked about the transfer issue.",
    "After all, the shopping experience was so bad that I started to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.",
    "I guess I won't be getting it today either.",
    "The adhesive is too weak, and it is not waterproof.",
    "",
    "The pen is OK, but the packaging is rather primitive. It's just a paper box, and there are no protection measures. And the box for holding the pen is sealed with a large piece of transparent tape, and when you tear off the tape, it's stuck to the box.",
    "We were treated like this for 600 yuan, and it was a very disappointing shopping experience.",
    "However, the pen is fine.",
    "I hope to see further improvements in packaging in the future!",
    "Quality is not bad, but if it comes to writing, 925-25 is better.",
    "Let's give a thumbs up to DHL Express today. Air freight is super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!",
    "I've been using 925-25 for a long time and it's great, I just received 925-85 and the quality is excellent, the design is very beautiful, and that's why I gave it four stars: the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing, and the lead adjustment at the end of the lead spring is a bit wobbly. In my opinion, 925-25 is more",
    "Thus, he became an Amazon loyalist.",
    "The super-low price is a bargain, but the children do not like the stylus pen.",
    "It has been opened, so I tried to apply for a refund, and they even offered to pick it up for free.",
    "That's too cool.",
    "We do not recommend returns, but this is the only service of its kind in China.",
    "Please don't abuse it.",
    "In the future, all the books I buy will be here.",
    "Earphones have a tendency to distort sound, and there is also noise interference.",
    "This headset is garbage, I don't know if my ears are the problem, or if this headset is actually not as good as it used to be.",
    "I bought a blue one two years ago on a website called eBay, which sounded quite good without any noise, the bass was also quite good, and I used it for over two years. I am now planning to buy another one (URBEATS), as I still feel that it is quite good.",
    "I looked at another one in purple, which was quite nice to look at, but when I opened it today I didn't like the sound. The sound was either loud or quiet.",
    "At first, I thought that the reason for the distortion of the song was that the sound effects were not good, but after listening for half a day, I realized that this problem was very serious. Not only was the tone off, but the bass effect was also not as good as before, and there was some interference. Is this only true for the purple headphones I bought? Or is the current headphone manufacturing technology really not up to standard?",

    "I just bought a DN1080 from Germany on August 14, and it looks like the workmanship is very poor.",
    "The front panel and the knobs are made of plastic.",
    "The audio input jack on the rear panel is not very good, and the speaker output terminals are also poor. A CD amplifier integrated machine with a power rating of 1000-2000 is much better than this one.",
    "The top cover is relatively thin, and my transformer side is even sunken downwards. I had to open the box and restore it with my hands, and the top cover and front panel are loose when they are joined together.",
    "The entire weight of the machine is biased toward the transformer end, and it is difficult to move it.",
    "It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just from the quality of the workmanship. This was made in Malaysia.",
    "Sony's outsourcing to China seems to be much better than Little Mac.",
    "The machine gets hot, and the temperature of the two-channel 2-hour-long speakers used to watch a movie is about 40-50\u00b0C. I don't know whether the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.",
    "Nowadays, we use switching power supplies. I estimate that this dumb transformer weighs about 4 kg.",
    "Sony should have used a quiet fan with active cooling inside the machine. After opening the box, all we saw were large aluminum heat sinks on the pipes.",

    "I was shocked! The sound quality was actually 3D surround!",
    "I asked the price at a physical communication store, and it was around 30 yuan, but it was not the brand name, but a generic brand, so I can say that this Pisen 27 is absolutely worth its price!",
    "The worst online shopping experience",
    "After placing the order on September 28, the system showed that the goods had been shipped, but I did not receive the goods until October 12.",
    "To check the status of Amazon orders, sellers do not provide shipping labels, so it is impossible to find out where the order is.",
    "I emailed the seller asking if they could provide the tracking number, but they didn't reply for two days.",
    "In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, and they gave me the seller's phone number. I called the seller and asked him about it. After a few attempts, the phone finally rang. I was told that the package had been lost, and I could get a new one immediately.",
    "Although I was particularly upset, because the computer needed it urgently, I didn't say much to the seller either, as long as it was sent to me immediately.",
    "The next day, I called to ask if the shipment had been sent?",
    "The seller says it's not ready yet, and it will be sent out in the afternoon.",
    "I called again in the afternoon to ask, and the seller said it would definitely be sent, and that it would be sent after 5 or 6 p.m. However, when I called again in the evening at 7 p.m., no one answered the phone.",
    "On the third day morning, I called again and asked if the goods had been shipped out?",
    "Can you tell me the order number?",
    "The seller said it was not available, and told me to order from another place if I was in a hurry, or to wait until the afternoon if I could wait.",
    "It's just that we can't wait that long to order from another place.",
    "All we can do is beg the seller to send it out right away.",
    "After many phone calls tracking me, I finally received a computer on October 16th.",
    "As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for someone else. I will add a review later.",
    "The half-year-old one was not used very often, and now it has a bad contact. Can it be repaired?",
    "Because of the desktop computer, I haven't used it much after buying it.",
    "I only bring it out when I travel, and use it a few times.",
    "Recently, it was discovered that when power is connected, it does not charge, and it is necessary to hold the connection point of the charger and the power cord with your hands to the left and right a few times in order to charge.",

    "Amazon should stop using EMS!",
    "Five stars for the goods, one star for logistics, and an average of three stars.",
    "Amazon should send by EMS, which is widely regarded as unreliable. After all, computers are valuable items, right?",

However, in the evening, when I didn't receive any phone calls or text messages, I checked the logistics, and found that the goods had been delivered in the middle of the day! And the delivery was marked as being signed for by myself!",

    "Who am I? Where am I? Is this computer mine?",
    "It's like I've been doubting my life!",
    "I only brought my computer back after running to the drop-off point to collect it.",
    "The specific reason is quite simple: the courier guys got the two tracking numbers mixed up, but fortunately the package was not lost.",
    "I strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS. In the future, if Amazon uses EMS to ship its packages, I will definitely not buy it anymore.",
    "The goods are good.",
    "First, I discovered that the price had been reduced after I had used it for a few days, and there were many negative reviews. However, the quality was still quite good, and the price-performance ratio was high, with sufficient CPU and graphics card performance for mainstream online games and a good portion of large single-player games. The heat dissipation was excellent, but the screen was a bit dim (a common problem with IPS screens), and the sound quality was poor.",
    "Don't buy keyboards with stickers from the E Cool Digital Center in the EBAY store in Shenzhen. They deliver slowly, the quality is bad, and if there are problems with the products, they won't refund or exchange them. Also, the store owner talks a lot of dirty talk. We'll highlight this a bit.",
    "The food is good, and the bureaucracy is still there.",
    "The hard drive quality is very good, the price-performance ratio is absolutely high, and it's cheaper than in Hong Kong. If you're not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate shipping, it's definitely recommended to buy it.",
    "However, it must be said that the Amazon platform is still bureaucratic, and there has been no improvement since a few years ago when I swore I would never use it: you can never find out the actual delivery status, information always arrives several weeks later, you can never complain, and that's how bureaucratic it is!",
    "The goods have been delivered for a few days now, but the logistics information is still that you will receive the goods in about 10 days!",
    "Logistics are not reliable.",
    "It came in this condition, with the packaging crumpled and the electrical packaging open. I don't know if it was re-packaged.",
    "FYI",
    "We have not yet tested it, but we have always trusted Philips and hope that the battery life is longer than that of other brands.",
    "I searched the internet, and this is a common problem with the waterproofing, and there is no warranty.",
    "Depression!",
    "Can I continue to use it covered with a vacuum film for now? I don't know how long it will last?",
    "You can buy second-hand items that have been disassembled.",
    "Paying a tax of over a hundred dollars for a machine that costs over three hundred is indeed a bit high, but now it feels more balanced at six hundred.",
    "When I received it, the closure strip looked like it had been opened and re-sealed, so I took a photo right away. Sure enough, when I tore it open, it opened right away. After opening it, the inner paperboard was damaged, and I was worried that it was someone else's return, so I tried it out on my husband before the anniversary. Luckily, the machine wasn't even plugged in, but it was a",
    "Whether or not it is good to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As the previous reviews indicate, the stuff that is sent out when it is out of stock is definitely not reliable!",
    "The experience is on the higher side",
    "It's almost at the top level of electric toothbrushes, with many different brushing modes, but few people change the modes on a daily basis, right?",
    "There were no problems for the first half year, I brushed it every day, and it was crashed about once every 1.5 weeks.",
    "Amazon sells the brush heads at the same low price.",
    "The app is a bit hard to use, besides changing the color, there are other issues that seem to be compatible due to the reasons of the foreign version?",
    "I hope to learn the Dharma.",
    "The price is very reasonable.",
    "I've used it three or four times already.",
    "1. The packaging is intact.",
    "It is very easy to use and easy to clean.",
    "It is possible to do your own hair styling, which saves money.",
    "In conclusion, this was a very successful purchase.",
    "There is counterfeit merchandise.",
    "Last time I bought two packs, and they turned out to be two different versions, and the words in the lower left corner of the packaging were green, but in one of the packs, the words were white, and the cat ate it and got sick.",
    "I don't know whether the Amazon's goods are fake or not, or whether the goods were lost in transit due to employee negligence. I can't tell.",
    "If the goods are still counterfeit, I will buy them again, but if they are still counterfeit, I will hold you and your related personnel responsible.",
    "This is a horizontal bar!",
    "Amazon pictures show side hustles, but I received one about full-time jobs, isn't that a scam?",
    "The effect is okay.",
    "Cats like to eat, that's the point.",

    "Tight, narrow, pinching feet and backs of feet.",
    "Do not recommend.",
    "Clarks' most comfortable series is UN, but this model is a complete failure.",
    "Added: Today I compared the UN series footbeds of my old shoes (the shoes were thrown away but the footbeds were kept), and the material was much inferior to the previous ones, the elasticity was not as good as before, and the breathability was not as good as before. It was just a fake soft.",
    "My heel is not very high, and the point of impact is about 3 cm forward from the highest point of my heel.",
    "I bought three pairs of Clarks abroad, but only one of them fits.",
    "I deleted all the pictures in my folder. I was scared.",
    "Try rockport again. If it doesn't work, you can only go to an ecco store in person.",
    "Substandard goods, poor quality control.",
    "First of all, it is worth noting that Prime international purchases are very reliable. My order on 31st was delivered on 6th.",
    "The shoes are much more attractive than the pictures show, and the leather feels good.",
    "The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 cm long and 10.5 cm wide, with a 7.5W heel. The upper part is slightly loose, but I like wearing it loose sometimes. I just need a pair of shoe insoles to fit.",
    "Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is truly unacceptable. One sole is damaged, and the other has scratches and a pinhole. The connection between the shoe body and sole is misaligned, and the shoe body and sole are clearly made of inferior materials!",
    "I regret it!",
    "I bought it for 280 yuan when I did the activity, which is a very good price for Asics. Of course, there are even lower prices if you read the reviews.",
    "Now let's talk about shoes. Their advantages are that they are light, running is quite comfortable, and they fit well, without feeling loose and floppy.",
    "The value is high but the flaws are also quite obvious: I usually wear shoes of size 40, but this time I bought a pair of size 40.5, and the front of the shoe is still about 1 thumb's width away when I put it on, but this doesn't affect anything.",
    "These shoes are very \"narrow,\" although there is still a distance between them, but they feel tight.",
    "Also, the shoes may not be very breathable, and now my feet feel very hot.",
    "Press the back of your foot.",
    "The shoes are well made, and they are worth the price.",
    "My feet are quite standard, I wear shoes size UK7.5, EU41.5, leather shoes UK6.5, and I have bought a few pairs of Amazon's Alegre, but I have never experienced any discomfort with them. However, this pair, I bought size UK7, and after wearing it, it was obvious that it was too big in length, but because the insole was too thick, it was still quite un",
    "If your feet are not particularly thin, I would not recommend buying this model.",
    "If you really have to buy it, you can also replace the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, so it would be a shame not to use it.",
    "This was a very perfect shopping trip!",
    "Very satisfied, very pleased with Amazon Global Shopping, there is no doubt that the products are genuine. The quality is also very good, and the prices are reasonable. Buying from Amazon is very reassuring, and the after-sales service is very thoughtful. The customer service attitude is very friendly and considerate, and they are very patient and effective in handling problems. They have perfectly solved the worries after purchase, and the logistics delivery service is very convenient and safe",
    "In short, we all love shopping at Amazon overseas!",
    "Absolute negative reviews!",
    "The agent company and Amazon are simply beyond words.",
    "When buying electronic products on Amazon in the future, be careful.",
    "Although it's been a long time, we still have to come and complain about it.",
    "I bought it in the winter for a few dollars, but I haven't used it for several months.",
    "When I needed it in the spring, I found that it would not connect to either the watch or the heart rate band, and both devices' manuals indicated support for the other, later I realized that it was probably a problem with the heart rate band, because I could not connect it to other devices.",
    "Amazon customer service helped me contact the agent company, and the agent company charged me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing.",
    "After nearly half a month, the items were returned to me in their original condition, even the delivery box was the same one I used when I sent them!",
    "There is no response, return receipt, or test report!",
    "Tell me, is it good or bad?",
    "Call and ask to have it sent back this way to indicate that the device is in good working order, and that is a good thing.",
    "But I still can't connect to it, and the agent's response is: that's not their problem.",

    "The delivery man is very proactive and very enthusiastic.",
    "Give a thumbs up!",
    "The product is simple, and it's not bad.",
    "However, I have never bought similar products before, so I cannot compare prices!",
    "Size, logistics",
    "The quality is good, but the logistics are slow. Previously, all of our shoes were shipped by DHL, and this time, Apex is... We've bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. It feels like Apex is of a higher quality than NIKE and ADIDAS?",
    "After all, they're all the same, so I'll buy them online.",
    "Size: I'm 176cm tall, weigh 68kg, my shoulders are generally 180cm wide, I bought M, the hem was slightly longer, the rest fit perfectly, I saw that there were S-size recommendations, do you think that a body so slim should wear a tighter one? I think a loose-fitting one is better for a cap sleeve.",
    "Size is just right.",
    "Breast size: 99, height: 184, weight: 84 kg, I consulted the customer service before purchase and was told that I should buy an XL, then I bought L based on the reviews and the size was just right. After receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right. I almost got scammed.",
    "The prices for Double 11 are much higher than those for Black Friday.",
    "The quality of the clothing is very good.",
    "Z's cheap products are a real pain!",
    "The 18th day's single, which was delivered on the 25th, is the speed of the snail from Guangzhou to Beijing!",
    "The product is the cheapest one we bought, and the description clearly stated that it had scratches. However, after receiving the goods, we found that it was missing four screws and screw caps!",
    "The child didn't want to return the item, thinking that the problem wasn't that big, but the small parts such as the fittings are difficult to find even in nearby hardware stores! The grandfather of the child had to run to several nearby hardware stores before he could find them!",
    "The grandfather gave it to him!",
    "Looks like we won't be able to buy the most affordable goods in the future!",
    "The quality of toy processing is poor.",
    "Most of the bolt holes are misaligned, tightening the screws is very difficult, so it is obvious that the processing quality is poor, and it is not known how long it can be played for, because it is something promised to the children, so there is no way to return it.",
    "Other reviews say that installing them is easy, but is that only true for the one I bought that has a problem?",
    "That's very normal.",
    "Is it because my luck is bad?",
    "The packaging is too old; the quality is poor; there is only one kind of music, and it is only 8 seconds long, and then repeats itself; and the action is just nodding your head while walking forward, with no variation.",
    "It's not worth that much.",
    "If you need it urgently, you can't return it.",
    "The toys are of good quality, and I'll complain about the packaging a bit.",
    "I received a package yesterday, from Amazon, marked EMS delivery. The last part was delivered by the logistics of Tmall. How many turns did it take to get here? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?",
    "I'll also say a few words about the packaging. It's just that it's wrapped in a few layers of vacuum seal film, and there's no packaging plastic bubble paper inside. Open it up and all the components are just in the empty box, which is fortunately of good quality. There aren't any broken components, just that it's smaller than expected, since it doesn't have a battery. Pushing it",
    "Quality is good, it's fun to play.",
    "It's a lot of fun, the precision of the components is very high, the workmanship is very fine, and the quality is comparable to Lego's, and the prices are very attractive when you hold an event.",
    "The process of assembling is pretty interesting, I come to assemble, and my 5-year-old son comes to play, that's great.",
    "He kept laughing, he probably will continue to buy toys from this brand in the future.",
    "The machine is new, and shopping online is good.",

    "We've already bought Zelda, and we've played it. Let's try it again.",
    "To produce defective goods, to sell defective goods, and to provide defective service. The result is that the watches are defective, and the time on them is inconsistent, varying by as much as several hours. Six watches were purchased for a child, and one of the digits on one of them was not complete. The time on the six watches was also inconsistent, varying by as much as several hours.",
    "I contacted the manufacturer and asked if the watches had been checked for accuracy when they were received. They replied, \"Yes\", so if there was such a difference in time, then it must be because the watches are not accurate. Simply put, it's just a low-quality product (not what I said is bad, just look at it: it's obvious that there is a quality problem (incomplete digital display)). The low-quality products have been sold",
    "I contacted the seller, and the seller gave me a lot of reasons, and also complained that they shouldn't have sold their products initially, such products, such sellers, and such after-sales service. In the future, who would dare to buy things on Amazon.",
    "In general, I don't recommend buying anything from this seller. Even if you do, you'll end up with junk.",
    "Amazon shipping problems",
    "Upon receiving the goods, I discovered that:",
    "1. The packaging of the watch is severely damaged.",
    "The spec sheet indicates severe use of creasing.",
    "3. The clock does not move, the desk lamp cannot be charged, and it cannot be adjusted for time.",
    "4. Contact Amazon Customer Service and have it shipped to the United States for a fee. The shipping fee will be refunded later.",
    "The reason for the 5.2 score is that the customer service is not bad.",
    "It only fits.",
    "Time isn't very accurate, it's about a second faster each day, and it's been almost two minutes faster for about three months.",
    "I used a piece of a Seiko watch before, and I think it will last for several years without losing a few seconds.",
    "The calendar function is actually pretty good, but the timer function is a bit of a nuisance. It's basically useless and you rarely need to use it. Sometimes you accidentally touch it and enter the timer mode.",
    "Solar-powered watches",
    "Advantages: Solar charging does not require replacing batteries, and it has world time, various alarm clocks, and an alarm at the top of the hour.",
    "The disadvantage is that mirrors are easily scratched and get dusty.",
    "The price-performance ratio: The general price in China is between 220 and 300 yuan, and you can get it for about 180 yuan (about 1 week's use) abroad.",
    "Very satisfied with the watch.",
    "The watch is definitely genuine. I checked the goods in the specialist shop and the watch's appearance is very attractive, the workmanship is meticulous, and the materials are of high quality. In addition, it also has an imported mechanical movement, so it is heavier than ordinary mechanical watches and cannot be compared with those in the range of three or four hundred. This is a genuine watch.",
    "The watch is very accurate in terms of timekeeping, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. The watch comes with a jewelry certification document, and the 12-point marker on the dial is real diamonds. This watch is very suitable for oneself to wear, and it also makes a good impression when given as a gift.",
    "Bently is certainly not bad.",
    "The worst shopping experience in history.",
    "On the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone. I became excited and immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon Malaysia. It is not a self-owned product, but there is no price increase. Due to the slower delivery speed of non-self-owned products, the system displayed that the earliest delivery date was September 27.",
    "My wife was suffering from not having a phone, so she called me at 6:30am the next morning to ask me to think of a solution. Later, I went to JD.com and saw that there was a 256G phone in stock that could be delivered the same day, so I had to immediately order another one.",
    "New orders are ready, so I'm thinking about canceling the Amazon orders right away.",
    "Because the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to pick up the package in the morning, so at 7:30 I called customer service to cancel the order, and they responded that the order had already been canceled and to wait for a text message.",
    "Well, I just waited patiently, and when I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the \"not yet shipped\" status. I immediately contacted customer service to ask them to cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service responded that the operation was already OK.",
    "By the afternoon at 3 o'clock, the order was still not processed, so I couldn't do anything but call the customer service again and make it clear that I had called three times already. I asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller that they must not ship the goods!",
    "Customer service contacted the seller on my request, and informed me that the seller is not familiar with the system, and that I should wait until the seller is familiar with the system before cancelling the order.",
    "However, I was assured that the seller knows about this and will not ship the item, so please be assured.",
    "When I checked the order status on Monday, I was surprised to see that the order had already been shipped. I was speechless.",
    "Since it was not possible to contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.",
    "The follow-up treatment is almost unbelievable. Basically, I would say something, and the customer service representative would then perform the operation.",
    "Orders are still in the process of being refused for delivery, and we are about to send them again!",
    "Amazon wouldn't be following up, would it?",
    "The seller's company was already paid, so it didn't matter if they didn't follow up.",
    "In the future, there is no way to pre-pay for big items, it's too troublesome that way.",
    "It looks very beautiful.",
    "I've been eyeing this camera for a long time, but for various reasons, I didn't buy it. This time, because of the discounted shipping, the price is also reasonable, so I bought it.",
    "After I bought it, there were no problems with other things, except that it couldn't connect to the software when I connected it, and my router is TP. After I went online to find out about this, I found that many people also had this problem. I spent two and a half hours trying different settings for the router, and in the end, I used 360WIFI as a medium to make it work. During this time, I called the Mi customer service",
    "Another point worth noting is that users have commented online that the minimum storage card supported by this camera is 8GB, and storage capacity smaller than that will not be recognized, so please pay attention to this.",
    "Using it feels alright, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is poor, and the machine has a certain amount of heat. If it is always on, the heat level feels a bit hard to accept.",
    "As a result, there are many shortcomings in this product. I hope that everyone will be careful when buying it.",
    "The reason I gave it three stars is because this was the first love I bought, and I have been dating it for almost three years. It left me last year, and it has stayed with me ever since.",
    "This is why I gave it 3 stars, because it was bought for the first love of my life, and I don't know how much use it has been put to now. Perhaps I've thrown it away?",
    "We have been in contact for almost three years, and she left me last year. Whenever I think of her, I feel so sad that I want to leave this world. She is the first woman in my life, and she has left a shadow and a pain that I have not been able to overcome.",
    "When I bought this phone, I thought about two things at the time: we can still go through thick and thin together, but now it's a memory I can't bear to look back on. Perhaps life is like this: some people don't want to meet, and some things they don't want to know about. But what can we do about it?",
    "Whenever I see a Samsung phone, I think of her, and that pain comes over me like a flood, I've never used a phone worth more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought one for her, I did not hesitate, even if the person is good, there will be no point in swearing and making promises if they change their minds one day.",
    "High-quality products from domestic brands",
    "Huawei is a high-quality product from China.",
    "The low-key CEO and the company rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business climate in which companies try to increase their reputation through advertising!",
    "Companies without the ability to do so simply cannot and dare not do it!",
    "It is for this reason that I chose Huawei.",
    "I've had it for more than half a year now, and I feel that it's been very good, and it's excellent.",
    "It was not a full score because there was a problem when I used it offline navigation, which was not located, and I did not find the reason. Otherwise, it was good.",
    "It's also very convenient that it automatically designs a route after searching for a destination online, and it's very useful that it automatically offline navigation after leaving the WiFi. After leaving the WiFi, it directly communicates with the satellite to achieve location and navigation, which is very good!",
    "Sony is a good law firm.",
    "Sony's low-end model is still full of design, and it is cheap, and the screen is big, and the battery life is excellent, which makes it a good choice for the elderly.",
    "Although time has passed by a long time, this machine still has no problems.",
    "However, because my Z2 was downgraded, this phone has also fulfilled its mission."
