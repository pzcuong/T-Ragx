    "The Impact of COVID-19 on the Illicit Drug Market",
    "Its impact may be similar to the 2008 economic crisis",
    "The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.",
    "In many countries, this disease has caused medical services to be overwhelmed and on the verge of collapse, and the measures taken by governments to restrict it have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.",
    "The impact of this epidemic on the drug market is not clear, and it is difficult to predict, but it may be profound.",
    "Some producers may be forced to find new ways to produce drugs as restrictions on mobility also limit access to precursors and basic chemicals.",
    "Traffickers, who are unable to travel due to restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.",
    "The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and governments' ability to respond may be hampered.",
    "The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from past crises.",
    "After the 2008 financial crisis, some drug addicts began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injecting drugs.",
    "Meanwhile, governments have cut budgets related to drugs.",
    "If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, prevention measures such as drug abuse prevention and related risky behaviors, as well as drug addiction treatment services, may be hit hard.",
    "In addition, the priority of interdiction and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for dealers to operate.",
    "Some countries have smuggled a large amount of drugs through commercial flights, and it is estimated that these countries will suffer the most direct impact from drug trafficking.",
    "Couriers have been known to carry precursor chemicals such as methamphetamine in their pockets or conceal them in their luggage, sometimes in large quantities.",
    "Although the international postal supply chain has been disrupted, the activities of trafficking using the dark web and mail delivery may increase.",
    "In the long term, economic recession and related measures may disrupt the drug market.",
    "Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poverty and vulnerable populations are more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug use disorders, and engage in illicit activities related to drugs, whether production or transportation.",
    "Drug trafficking organizations may exploit this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to bolster their ranks.",
    "These changes may quickly take root as the new reality for many communities as government capacity declines.",
    "Expansion and Complexity",
    "market growth",
    "the growth in population explains some of the reasons for the expansion of the market",
    "The global drug use phenomenon has been increasing, both in terms of the overall number and the proportion of drug users in the world population.",
    "In 2009, the estimated number of drug users was 210 million, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, the estimated number of drug users was 269 million, accounting for 5.3% of this population.",
    "In the past 20 years, the growth rate of drug addiction in developing countries is much faster than that in developed countries.",
    "This to a certain extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with the developed countries growing by 7%, developing countries by 28%, but also reflects the fact that the young population in developing countries grew faster.",
    "The proportion of young people and young adults in drug users is the largest.",
    "Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while the population in developed countries decreased by 10%.",
    "1. Urbanization is a driving force for the current and future drug market",
    "Whether it is developed countries or developing countries, the drug addiction situation in urban areas is more than that in rural areas.",
    "The overall increase in drug addiction is partly due to the large-scale migration of population from rural areas to urban areas. At present, more than half of the world's population live in urban areas, while the proportion in 1960 was only 34%.",
    "Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.",
    "The increase in drug use is associated with the increase in wealth, but the burden of disease is borne by the poorest people in the world, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.",
    "Cocaine and other drugs are more closely associated with wealthier regions of the world.",
    "Similarly, within each country, the prevalence of drug addiction is higher among the richer social strata.",
    "However, the ratio of addiction to drug-related diseases is relatively high among people with lower socio-economic status.",
    "Data from a few countries show that the harmful use of drugs is associated with low income and disease.",
    "These patterns seem less common in more affluent social strata.",
    "The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable populations, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labour market, such as rising unemployment, have historically been linked to increases in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced millions of people around the world out of work.",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic could further expand the illicit drug market, as the pandemic's large-scale outbreak may lead to more farmers growing illicit crops, or because of the weakening control of national regulatory agencies, or because more people are forced to engage in illegal activities due to the economic crisis.",
    "The related measures of COVID-19 may reduce air and land transportation, but increase sea transportation, which has a low risk of interception and more than air or land smuggling.",
    "Recently, there have been reports of cocaine being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.",
    "complexity is enhanced",
    "The emergence of non-controlled substances remains stable, but the new type of opioids with potential risks is increasing, and the drug market is becoming more and more complex.",
    "In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not subject to international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.",
    "Each year, there are about 500 new psychoactive substances in the domestic market of member countries.",
    "Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of synthetic opioids.",
    "Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "In 2014, the number of new psychoactive substances confirmed as new types of psychoactive substances was 181, of which only 2% were new types of synthetic opioids, but this figure had risen to 9% by 2018.",
    "Many of the new synthetic opioids are similar to fentanyl, and their effects and risks have been proven, causing overdose deaths in North America, and other regions, but the degree is lighter.",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine) and as a substitute for illicit opioids.",
    "Some evidence suggests that injecting new psychoactive stimulants is also happening in Europe: a study of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many were contaminated with substances that produce a stimulant effect.",
    "The use of new psychoactive substances may become increasingly entrenched in disadvantaged groups",
    "A single type of new psychoactive substance has never formed a large market.",
    "However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among homeless and prison populations.",
    "Twenty-two countries reported use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with synthetic cannabinoids being the main challenge in most.",
    "The control of precursor chemicals has forced manufacturers to innovate, with many chemicals used to synthesise buprenorphine, methamphetamine, amphetamine and \"ecstasy\" now under international control.",
    "Traffickers and producers have long sought alternatives, not just those that are less controlled, but also those specifically designed to evade controls, namely so-called \"designer precursors\".",
    "Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze synthetic precursor manufacturers.",
    "Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: it was reported in March 2020 that a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from Asia led to a rise in the price of methamphetamine in Mexico and the US.",
    "The market is in a state of flux",
    "Synthetic opioids replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation",
    "The heroin market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.",
    "The amount of opioids seized by the Russian federal authorities has dropped by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has dropped significantly.",
    "But the stimulant market seems to be thriving.",
    "There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrovalerone, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.",
    "The number of clandestine laboratories producing illicit drugs discovered by Russian authorities has surged in recent years, more than doubling in the past two years, with 152 discovered in 2018, according to Russian authorities.",
    "Afghanistan and Iraq methamphetamine markets grow",
    "An investigation of hospital, prison and other staff in 2012 already revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.",
    "Crystal methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, alongside heroin and tramadol.",
    "A study in 2015 further confirmed these findings, with addicts saying cannabis was harder to get than \"fenethylline\" or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine manufacturing sites, and the INCB has expressed concern about large quantities of pseudoephedrine-based preparations being imported for use in methamphetamine production.",
    "In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production appears to have begun in 2014.",
    "Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily rising.",
    "But seizures in the first half of 2019 were 16.57 kg - a sharp increase from the previous year.",
    "Large quantities of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, indicating that production is rapidly increasing.",
    "Policy changes and trends",
    "The legalization of non-medical cannabis use has been accompanied by a trend towards increased cannabis use.",
    "Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the US allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "In most jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use.",
    "In the two earliest states to pass legislation, Colorado and Washington , the prevalence of nonmedical cannabis use among adults has increased, especially in the past month and daily or almost daily use, which has been above the national average since 2012 .",
    "All indicators show that marijuana use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, and last month it almost doubled.",
    "This increase was mainly due to frequent use.",
    "Canadian short-term data also shows that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.",
    "However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products illegally.",
    "Is the dramatic decline in global cannabis herb seizures due to cannabis legalization?",
    "In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb reached the lowest level in the past 20 years, because seizures in North America dropped by 84% over the past 10 years.",
    "In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled. The seizure pattern suggests that policies aimed at loosening the cannabis market are having a key impact.",
    "Monitoring of new psychoactive substances appears to have had some impact on the domestic market, but it is still difficult to assess the impact of monitoring of new psychoactive substances.",
    "Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances have shown different rates of use of new psychoactive substances.",
    "In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation.",
    "Disadvantaged populations are disproportionately harmed by both legal and illegal drug markets for opioids used for pain management and palliative care , with opioid use varying widely by region and income level .",
    "In 2018 , more than 90 % of all medical consumption of opioids were in high income countries .",
    "About 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.",
    "These countries accounted for approximately 12 % of the global population .",
    "It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids is less than 10%.",
    "the barriers to obtaining opioids are multifactorial , including legislation , culture , health systems , and prescribing practices .",
    "The risk of addiction is greater for poorer people. In 2018, about 35.6 million people were addicted to drugs.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of opioid use disorder and worsen its consequences. Evidence from high-income countries shows that these individual disadvantages - which are not just a snapshot of someone's situation at a particular point in time - are also associated with the risk of opioid use disorder.",
    "Addiction also exacerbates social and economic disadvantage, further increasing the risks of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, and perpetuating the vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be linked to the stigmatising attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, ethnic minorities, migrants, diverse sexual orientations, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and those living in rural environments are also likely to be disproportionately affected by opioid use or to face challenges in accessing treatment.",
    "The harmful effects of smoking on a broader range of social influences have worsened over the past decade, as measured by the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death.",
    "Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years lost due to drug use increased by 17%.",
    "The increase in DALYs from untreated hepatitis C-related liver cancer among injecting drug users was particularly high - 40%.",
    "The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and difficult to determine the causal relationship between substance use and violence.",
    "Global data suggest that drunkenness may be an important factor in homicide.",
    "But in violent events, alcohol seems to have a greater effect than drugs.",
    "Although drug use may be associated with crime, in some cases this association can be partially attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as social and economic disadvantage and other types of adversity that are influenced by personal risk, family environment, and peers.",
    "The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, including large scale organized crime, it is possible that these activities can be carried out without violence.",
    "In the short term, the presence and degree of violence are more likely to depend on the quantity of the drug being trafficked than on some change that makes the power balance between organized criminal groups unstable, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of known criminals, or law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.",
    "The latest trends",
    "Marijuana is the most commonly used substance and opioids pose the greatest risk",
    "An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug globally.",
    "In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "But the related harms of opioids are often overlooked because of the relatively small number of users.",
    "In 2017, an estimated 167,000 deaths were related to drug use, 66% of which were caused by these substances, and 50% of the 210 million years of life lost due to premature death or disability caused by drug use were caused by these substances.",
    "Synthetic opioid nonmedical use exacerbates public health crisis",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the enhanced opioid crisis is tramadol; in North America, it is fentanyl. These regions have almost no commonalities in economic, demographic or general drug use patterns, but they are all struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and cheap substances.",
    "In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a surge in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.",
    "In 2018, fentanyl was involved in two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the US.",
    "Canada has reported similar results, with lower numbers.",
    "One reason fentanyl is contributing to overdose deaths is that the potency of illicit fentanyl is unpredictable.",
    "The market for tramadol used for non-medical purposes has grown significantly in West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa.",
    "In that region, more and more people using tramadol for pain relief are seeking treatment.",
    "In 2017, the global seizure of tramadol reached a peak of over 125 tons, a significant increase.",
    "But in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate tramadol, global seizures fell to 3,200 kg.",
    "The two crises were fuelled by the simplicity and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international oversight of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.",
    "The two crises were worsened by the fact that these substances are available on both the legal and illegal markets, making it harder to detect and prevent their misuse.",
    "The use of stimulants is on the rise",
    "The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing rising use in their main markets.",
    "About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, because cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "Some 27 million people used methamphetamine that year, with methamphetamine hydrochloride being the most commonly used methamphetamine type in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for 20 years.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that when one drug's use goes up, the other goes down, sometimes both increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet the same market demand.",
    "COVID-19 increases the risk of injection drug users",
    "An estimated 11.3 million people inject drugs in 2018, and about 10% of the global HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.",
    "More than 100,000 people who inject drugs have HIV, and 5.5 million have Hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, about 585,000 people died of drug addiction, half of them died of liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the hepatitis C in injecting drug users is still untreated.",
    "5. The shortage of opioids caused by the COVID-19 restrictions may lead to users substituting with alcohol or benzodiazepines, which are easier to obtain, or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs.",
    "With some users switching to injecting or injecting more frequently, there may be more harmful use.",

    "[Global Times Brussels Special Reporter Niu Ruifeng] According to Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that EU leaders agreed to adopt stricter policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to expel illegal immigrants.",
    "According to the report, the EU's move is a response to the growing concern of the increasing number of illegal immigrants in Europe. The core problem of the EU now is that the number of illegal immigrants who can be expelled is very small.",
    "According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to \"immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds\" to strengthen the external borders through infrastructure and monitoring measures.",
    "However, the European Union and its member states have been arguing over the payment of the cost of the border.",
    "Von der Leyen repeatedly said that the EU funds would not pay for the costs.",

    "According to the European Commission, the asylum applications received by the EU member states last year exceeded 920,000, which was nearly half of the previous year.",
    "At the same time, the European Union recorded more than 330,000 illegal border crossings last year.",

    "US upgrades \"chip war\" to create a new global semiconductor industry - China News",
    "Recently, the US has made a significant upgrade to the \"chip war\" against China. First, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to control the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under US pressure; then, foreign media reported that the US government was considering cutting off all connections between US suppliers and Huawei, and prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden government also prepared to issue an administrative order to restrict US investment in China's sensitive technology industries",
    "In recent years, the US has never stopped its actions to suppress China's \"core\" development. On the one hand, it has precisely targeted the supply chain of semiconductor production for China, and on the other hand, it has built a semiconductor industry alliance to de-Sinicize, with the aim of completely \"throwing off\" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.",
    "Whether it is to attract South Korea to establish a \"technology alliance\", or to establish a \"chip quadrilateral alliance\" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a semiconductor industry \"small circle\" through the mechanism of the US-Japan-Australia \"four-party mechanism\" and the \"Indo-Pacific Economic Framework\", the United States has introduced political, partisan, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry to",
    "However, the US\u2019s \u201cchip warfare\u201d against China is also \u201cwounding the enemy and wounding oneself\u201d.",
    "Recently, the well-known semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, announced that due to the impact of the latest round of export control measures on the export of Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the group plans to dismiss 1,300 full-time employees and 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.",
    "Recently, ASML, a global leader in lithography, warned that the ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China may lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.",
    "According to the analysis of American media, after the US government imposed a very heavy suppression on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies were seriously affected, including EDA tool developers, chip designers, crystal manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.",
    "The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.",
    "The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a global semiconductor industry chain has already formed.",
    "According to the estimation of experts, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the border of more than 70 countries, and the whole process takes 100 days.",
    "Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing, especially in advanced processes and technology, and is heavily dependent on the Asia-Pacific region.",
    "Even if the United States strives to lead the advanced semiconductor production and supply chain to develop into a \"small circle\" regionalization, it is difficult to change the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries.",
    "The United States is strongly \"restructuring\" and \"de-Sinicization\" of the semiconductor industry chain, and re-creating the global semiconductor industry.",
    "Chips are the core of the future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of all countries in the world.",

    "After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the closure and flight of the organization caused members to panic, and the public security and human resources departments intervened.",
    "Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization came forward to respond and promised to make efforts to protect the legal rights and interests of employees and members, thus the storm was calmed down.",
    "Some fitness centers have encountered business problems and temporarily closed some of their stores. Consumers can remain calm and wait for the problem to be resolved. Why are many members\u2019 first reactions \u201csomething is wrong\u201d?",
    "Behind the wave of member rights protection in the fitness club, there is a deep-rooted problem of trust crisis in the industry.",
    "In China, traditional fitness clubs generally adopt the pre-paid fee model, and \u201cearning money from customers who don\u2019t come\u201d is the underlying logic of their development.",
    "Through the pre-sale of membership cards to obtain cash flow, and continuously opening new stores, it seems to be able to form a cycle, but in fact it is a case of \"eating the rice of others\", and it is impossible to form a stable profit model.",
    "The negative information about the fitness club and other industries is frequent, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.",
    "From the perspective of market prospects, fitness clubs are indeed a good business with \u201cmoney-making potential\u201d.",

    "A lot of data shows that the heat in the field of physical consumption is continuously rising, and the market is continuously warming up.",
    "Specifically, in the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents\u2019 living standards, the concept of healthy living has become deeply rooted in people\u2019s minds, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.",
    "The better the trend, the more important it is to develop quality.",
    "However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumption recovery, and they are blowing the horn of expanding the territory and opening new stores, and they are pouring all the investment funds into the construction of new stores.",
    "It cannot be denied that, due to the influence of the epidemic, many institutions have withdrawn from the market, and the industry has been reshuffled, and some enterprises with real strength have selectively increased their acquisition strength and restructured, which is a new opportunity.",
    "However, to develop the fitness market and enter a virtuous circle, the industry must change its traditional mode and adjust its operating strategy.",
    "Only by stabilizing and consolidating, and re-establishing the trust and safety of consumers, can we truly win the market and the future.",

    "First, it is necessary to retain users through services.",
    "Fitness clubs belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to \"customer-oriented\", to focus on the needs of customers, and to put the center of management on the upgrading of services.",
    "Secondly, it is necessary to upgrade the user experience through digital transformation.",
    "For example, the popular Internet fitness club model allows users to pay by the session and choose their own location.",
    "At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, and social needs can also be met, realizing the complete service loop from online to offline.",
    "Without personal training promotion and high-priced annual membership, users' concerns about \"running away\" from fitness institutions have been reduced, and trust has also been improved.",
    "In addition, it is also necessary to actively explore multiple business models.",
    "Now, sports consumption has evolved from single service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are likely to become new consumption entrances, and the surrounding products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment will become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.",

Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released the economic data for January 2023.",
    "Experts believe that the performance of Taiwan's economy at the beginning of the year was not good, and the pressure of growth was not small.",

    "The financial management department of the Taiwan government believes that the global terminal demand has decreased, the industry adjustment of inventory has suppressed the willingness of merchants to purchase raw materials, and the export situation is very poor, and it is difficult to see an improvement in the short term. The export decline in the first quarter of Taiwan this year may be higher than expected.",

    "Wu Da Ren, professor of economics at the Central University in Taiwan, analyzed that the export downturn may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing enterprises, and the risk of debt default will rise.",
    "At the same time, the reduction of orders led to the reduction of labor costs for enterprises, which affected the labor market and family economy, and in turn affected consumption ability.",
    "Taiwan Institute of Economic Research researcher Qiu Dashuai believes that the inflation situation in Europe and America will not be resolved this year, and the demand will continue to shrink, and the export decline in Taiwan will continue until the first half of the year.",

The number of non-agricultural employment increased by 517,000, which was much higher than the market expectation of 189,000.

It may be corrected in the future (the new non-agricultural employment in January 2022 was revised from 504,000 to 364,000), and the",
    "From the structural perspective, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have seen a significant increase in new employment, and the data shows that the labor shortage in the service industry still exists.",
    "Combined with the strong rebound of service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor shortages data that exceeded expectations, and the strong consumption credit data, we judge that the US service industry has undergone a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.",
    "We believe that the tight supply and demand situation in the US labor market is difficult to improve without a recession.",
    "At present, the US labor market still has a supply gap of more than 5 million, and the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the high point before the epidemic.",
    "In addition, due to the strong demand for excess savings and consumption credit of American residents, the strong demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the labor market.",
    "The continuous tight labor market supply and demand will be the bottom line of the US economy in 2023.",
    "Adding to this is the fact that the end of the current round of interest rate hikes is in sight, and inflation expectations are expected to continue to fluctuate. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.",
    "Before the release of the data, the US bond market was overly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.",
    "With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed, while shortening the pace of rate hikes, still maintains the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market ignores the Fed's hawkish stance and expects to stop raising rates earlier and even cut twice at the end of the year.",
    "In the context of a tight labor market and the uncertainty of the impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance to raise interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the extreme market expectations for adjustment and trading will be compressed or will have some impact on the market.",
    "However, the persistent slowdown in inflation is likely to be a drag on wage growth, and the recent improvement in M2 and various CPI components suggests that U.S. CPI data has already entered a period of rapid decline, which will only serve as a floor for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to verify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.",

    "Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we don't know where you are going to send it back, so we will not refund your shipping fee.",
    "I don't understand this logic, I am a Japanese, I still need Chinese customer service, and people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service, but if you go to Japan, you don't have the ability to call internationally, so the problem is, who needs to call Amazon's overseas shopping in Chinese, it's just like me, a Japanese who buys things from Amazon.",

    "I hope it is genuine, the quality is guaranteed, otherwise I will not buy anything from Amazon in the future.",
    "I would rather pay a little more for domestic products, at least there is a guarantee.",
    "And the product packaging problem, I saw the reviews in 2016, and it's still the same in 2019.",
    "It shows that Amazon doesn't care about feedback on service at all, and it is far from JD.com and Tmall in China.",

    "Fake?",
    "In short, it's a tragedy.",

I called the customer service and said that I would show them the screenshot of the promotion at the time, but who buys things and saves the screenshot? It's your own promotion, and you need the customer to provide evidence. Everyone, please be careful",
    "After using it, I felt",
    "The first time I bought something on Amazon, I felt a few things, first of all, the feeling after using the product, it is indeed painless, and there is no stimulating smell, overall it is not bad, it takes about 8 minutes to wipe it off after resting, there is a little sweat and dirt on the surface, but it is not obvious if you don't look closely, so overall it is not bad, and I will continue to observe whether it is",
    "Anyway, I think this product is really good.",
    "The second is that I ordered it on the 27th and received it on the 12th, which is a total of 15 days, or half a month. The delivery staff of Amazon are also very good.",
    "Third, I don't believe Amazon's Black Friday anymore. I ordered it on Friday and waited for two days, and it was nearly 12 yuan cheaper. I paid more than 170 yuan (including shipping), and I felt that they were raising the price to promote the activity.",
    "The customer service said that the price fluctuation, I paid attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price fluctuation was not big.",

    "I think it is acceptable, because the price is relatively low, and the 700 pages are divided into two books, which is more convenient for reading as a paperback; secondly, it is different from the Michelangelo Complete Works, which is dominated by paintings, and the Da Vinci black and white manuscript is dominated by drawings, which is the best price-performance ratio for appreciating the drawings and manuscripts for budget-conscious and non-art-professional",

    "1. The price issue is not the most important thing, the key is how to change the blank book on the kindle to the book with real content now, instead of downloading \"waiting for the release\" forever.",
    "After pre-ordering the book, I will not buy it anymore, because if I jump the queue and download another book with empty content, it will be very complicated.",

    "When you read this book, you may recall the quarrelsome couple beside you, the tasteless marriage of your acquaintances, and the unsatisfactory love.",
    "This is why I don't recommend reading it, from the perspective of literary taste, the writing and plot are tasteless, unless your life is full of excitement and sweetness, like living in a candy castle, otherwise, you will feel that it is strange and boring when you read it.",
    "And from a depth of thought, the daily incidents do not illuminate or expand the reader's mind and vision (unlike Marquez's \"Love in the Time of Cholera\"), and the brief segments do not discuss any issues, such as what kind of mistake led to the failure of love?",
    "What were the reasons for the protagonist's marriage breakdown?",
    "So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't matter much.",
    "The author's ideas are more expressed through technique and tone than storyline, which is another reason why the reading experience is not great.",
    "It is suitable for coarse reading, but not for fine reading.",
    "The logic of the book is good, but the content is not rich enough.",
    "It explains a lot about sales theory and why, but it is very weak on how to do it, just pointing the direction but not giving specific methods.",
    "Also, the book felt like it was pieced together.",
    "For example, there are both domestic and foreign ones; there are both famous entrepreneurs or salesmen and those who are not well known but have a good reputation.",
    "It is not clear whether the stories are compiled for the sake of examples. If some cases that the author has experienced are cited, it would be more convincing.",
    "The title of the customer is changing from customer to customer.",
    "The title is still customers, but the content has changed to customers.",
    "There are also problems with misspelled words, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in the e-book.",
    "In general, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but it is not suitable for those who have already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales level.",
    "A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance",
    "This book is quite shallow, and can be said to be a beginner\u2019s course, which can help people quickly understand the overall situation of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still need to find a way to find it yourself and dig deeper.",
    "It was published earlier, and the content about the later Alipay and WeChat supplementing and complementing each other to cultivate user habits is not mentioned, and the proportion of third-party payment today is probably much smaller than what is said in the book.",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat with their mobile phones, and merchants also abandon UnionPay because of the high bank flow.",
    "However, I would like to thank the author for writing this introductory book. It is obvious that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, and is familiar with the development history of domestic and foreign finance, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.",
    "It is easy to write high-level abstracts, but it is difficult to write in plain language.",
    "I love you, and I want you to know it!",
    "The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether he or she is recognized and valued in the work.",
    "According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after people's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent thing is to meet their psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed and recognized.",
    "In fact, for the Chinese, most of them are \"love you in the heart and throat is difficult to open\", even if they love, thank and praise, they will keep it in their heart and will not say it out loud.",
    "In this book, the author explains the five languages of praise: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, gifts, and physical touch.",
    "I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them spontaneously and sincerely to appreciate, thank and praise the people around you, whether they are family members, friends or colleagues.",
    "In fact, the closer the people around us are, the more they need praise and gratitude, and our lives will be more beautiful.",
    "Learn to praise, and enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce turnover rate.",
    "Thanks to the translator for bringing us the exciting ideas and the world from abroad.",
    "Due to the differences in backgrounds of Chinese and Western cultures, there are differences in language. If there is an opportunity to see the original version, it will be more beneficial.",
    "Thanks to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!",
    "Suspected counterfeit products, please Amazon to review strictly",
    "The quality is super bad, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it is even worse than the products on the roadside stalls, there is no weight, no barcode, and even 10 bags are loose, which is a feature of not qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience of Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is a quality problem; I suggest merchants to open their eyes and refuse to buy low-quality goods; supplement: I",
    "We hope that Amazon can be more careful in the source of the goods.",
    "The products are not as good as expected.",
    "Advantages:",
    "1. Big brands, cheap prices.",
    "Advantage 2: The electric razor and the blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are also OK to use, but they are not as good as I expected.",
    "Disadvantages:",
    "1. No charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is saved, customers who buy 300 yuan products are considered to be discarded by Panasonic, with no respect.",
    "There is a strong smell, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, it can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.",
    "After using it for a day in the office, the whole house smells like the plastic smell.",
    "Compared with the Philips I used before at the same price, although it has a blade, the quality of this product is really not good for consumers.",
    "The packaging is small.",
    "I received the express delivery, and I saw the word \"electronic commerce version\" written on the top, so I knew that I had fallen into the pit again. It was much cheaper than buying it in the supermarket. The packaging was different from the picture in the product introduction, so it was the so-called new version.",
    "My three stars are for my own carelessness in not noticing the product specifications. I don't mind the M-sized version sold as an online version, but what does the version that is not the correct version mean?",
    "The online shop is too cunning, I will go to the supermarket to buy it if I have time.",
    "Just the sauce.",
    "I don't like the taste",
    "The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste, and always says it's spicy, maybe it would be more appropriate to use other words, but the child's vocabulary is limited to this word at the moment.",
    "I bought it during the promotion, it was very cheap, so I don't want to give it a bad review, so I will give it 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.",
    "it's the genuine article and the packaging is good",
    "The packaging is complete, and there is a gas bag inside, and there are only one product of the same brand as the one on the Internet.",
    "The plastic film on the outside of the bottle is as described in the picture, and the delivery was also very fast, and it arrived the second day after the photo was taken.",
    "It is the genuine product, but it is out of stock, and I don't know when it will be on sale again.",
    "A terrible shopping experience",
    "I ordered it during the 5.15, but it didn't arrive for a long time. After I asked, I found that the package had been delivered, but my colleagues said they didn't help me to sign for it. I had to contact the courier company urgently, but they said that I could only inquire after sending the package. I contacted Amazon's customer service, but it took more than ten days to find out that the courier had mistakenly",
    "The wrong picture",
    "I thought I would receive the earphones as shown in picture 1, but I received the earphones as shown in picture 2, the pictures are inconsistent, but what does the left and right earphone sound different mean?",
    "Although the name is the same, I hope everyone will pay attention to this. And please update the correct picture as soon as possible, thank you very much.",
    "The operating system is average.",
    "After using it for a while, the overall picture is okay, I don't feel any difference, but this system makes people feel complicated, the startup time is obviously slower, and the settings are not good, and the software that comes with it is not worth mentioning, and the response speed is even more general, and it is not a level compared to my colleague's.",
    "The design is said to be very humanized, but I couldn't find where it is humanized. The position of the up and down, left and right, and return keys on the remote control is really not good.",
    "So, just treat it as a TV and add a TV box or so.",
    "The price is too low.",
    "The price is too low, it's 100+ now, it's 99!",
    "Since Amazon has accumulated a lot of unrated orders, I use a copy of a sentence as the review content.",
    "If I use this sentence to evaluate, it shows that this product is at least 85 points.",
    "But I would never copy and paste the review for the products that are not so good, because other consumers would use it as reference, and the sellers would improve the quality of the products.",
    "The low price is good, it's enough if it doesn't burn!",
    "This so cheap cable should be able to meet the HDMI certification standard, and I have compared it with the dog shit in Akihabara (the price is twice as high), the cable is thick and sturdy, and it is also relatively soft, and there is no noise when transmitting 7 meters, and I will recognize the low-priced cable in the future!",
    "The goods are fine, but Amazon's after-sales service is really worse than other websites",
    "After placing an order, I found that I had made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order, and the online customer service on the website always showed the wrong link, and I couldn't get through.",
    "After the delivery, the delivery man called me and said that I didn't want it, and I wanted to cancel the order, but it failed to cancel, so the delivery man took it back and asked me to sign the receipt and apply for a refund.",
    "When I applied for a refund, I was told that food items cannot be returned once they have been received, and I couldn't get through to Amazon's customer service on the phone, and they also said the same thing, that it couldn't be returned once it had been received.",
    "I have bought things that cannot be returned according to the policy, including milk and paper diapers, from JD.com and Suning, and contacted the customer service to return them, and JD.com's paper diapers were returned after the customer service smelled them, but you Amazon can't do it.",
    "The rules are dead, people are alive, how do you deal with your customer service?",
    "Tell me what to do, whether I should take it myself or let the delivery man buy it himself. The delivery man is already difficult, why should I ask him to spend money to buy something that is not his?",
    "Okay, I didn't return it, I took it myself, but I have to give you a 1-star rating for your service.",
    "Please don't waste money",
    "First, I was looking forward to buying it, thinking that the Lecaf brand should not be bad, but after receiving it, I found that the packaging was still okay, but the taste was not good, and the head was not bad, but one box was basically soft, and it was not obvious from the outside, but it had no taste when touched and had no taste at all when eaten, it was tasteless and bland, and the fruit circle was dark yellow when bitten,",
    "Save yourself some time by buying clever. No more fruit from online shopping!",
    "Where is the anti-counterfeiting mark of the product?",
    "The bottle bottom corner is very deep, it must have experienced a strong impact, and the feeling of the packaging bag is too soft, which makes people feel uncomfortable, because the packaging is too simple for food, and it is also an international purchase, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark, and the bottle is very easy to open, the key is that the inner layer of honey directly comes out, and there is almost no adhesiveness when opening the mouth, and is this",
    "I don't understand it as a Chinese person.",
    "It should be genuine, right?",
    "There is also a prompt that says 20 when taking the photo, this is the 14th one I received, I bought it abroad for the first time, I just wrote down my doubts, maybe this is normal?",
    "Delivery service needs to be improved",
    "I bought 5 delivery vouchers, when I extracted them, I reserved 3 times for the first time, but only 2 were sent, and it was confirmed through multiple communication that it was a mistake and would be supplemented; the second time I reserved, I happened to be on a holiday, and the website and WeChat did not remind me to reserve on a working day, causing unnecessary anxiety, and it is suggested to improve it in the future.",
    "The shopping experience is good",
    "The goods are highly praised!",
    "I still trust the goods sold by Amazon itself. Now that I have bought things overseas, it is very convenient. The time for the goods to be transported from overseas to China is a few days longer than that for domestic goods, but I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear customs for goods bought overseas is very strong, and it is much faster than transshipment, so I buy many things overseas.",
    "I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to buy them after they go out and come back once, I hope to improve.",
    "Rubbish",
    "When you see this package, do you think it is roadside garbage?",
    "A plastic fragile packaging is sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this packaging responsible?",
    "I see that the packaging is the same as that for rubbish, and the product, packaging and its simplicity are all very poor, and there are no measures to prevent damage, so it is just a simple plastic bag, and the package is completely deformed when it arrives, and the contents are also damaged.",
    "If I just had one, I would have accepted it, but I had several, so I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I would have to pay for the shipping, and then they would refund me the shipping in the form of a gift card.",
    "I asked them, if I pay for the postage in cash, you give me a gift card, then you're asking me to buy a gift card and post it to your warehouse in Germany? That's not just buying a product, that's a pain in the backside!",
    "And I kept telling the customer service that it was their responsibility, but they didn't say a word, they didn't dare to take any responsibility, what kind of after-sales service is this? One word: rubbish! I guess Amazon won't give me a chance to publish this review, they will just delete it!",
    "The quality is good, 5 stars, but the logistics are bad.",
    "1. Quality is good, fast delivery, price is reasonable, value for money.",
    "2. Solid, good material, welds are tight, surface finish is good, color is good.",
    "3,The logistics is hard, the order number is 3, and the delivery time is 11.",
    "4, If Amazon had marked the expected delivery date as February 7th, I would have been very satisfied.",
    "5,But the expected delivery time was marked, which was equivalent to giving the user a promise, and when the promise could not be fulfilled, the user was very uncomfortable.",
    "6. If you don't have the confidence to make a promise, don't make a promise.",
    "7.In fact, I really care about the promises made by the merchants.",
    "So I gave a low rating.",
    "The gold line will fade",
    "The effect is still there, but whether it is obvious depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.",
    "The only thing that's not good is the gold line. It looks good in the design, but the gold line will fade, and if you put it on the car, if you touch it a few times, your hands and the car will have some gold powder.",
    "I hope the product can be improved.",
    "This kind of square shape doesn't have much decorative effect, so don't put gold lines on it, otherwise it will be dirty on the car.",
    "The goods are good, the speed is fast, and the two packages are not the same packaging.",
    "The speed is quite fast in 8 days, but it is divided into 2 packages, and the packaging is not the same. The anti-vibration is too much, and the thick paper is pasted on, and the plastic is wrapped in layers. The outer packaging is also easy to disassemble, and it is similar to a domestic express box. A few cushioning airbags are put in, and it feels a bit slack.",
    "The Yalan bedding is not bad",
    "The 34cm thick mattress is not the usual thickness, and it is not necessary to sleep directly on the mattress.",
    "The quality is good, whether it is the front or the back, it is quite soft, and the sleep is very comfortable, and it is easy to fall asleep when lying on it.",
    "The mattress arrived, but the courier was rough in transport, and there were two places with some stains. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and efficient in contacting and solving the problem.",
    "It's not self-operated goods, Amazon is not embarrassed",
    "The page clearly states that it is a self-operated product, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, and the after-sales service is also provided by the supplier. If there is a problem, please contact the supplier directly.",
    "Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been transferred to the supplier, can not be cancelled; want to return the goods, after Amazon successfully applied for the return, sorry, no one cares about you, need to contact the supplier to return the goods.",
    "This is a self-operated product.",
    "The goods are not sent by Amazon, and the after-sales service is not undertaken by Amazon. The customer service even said \"I will help you contact the supplier\", and claimed that it was self-operated, which is too shameless, and it is a shameless fraud against consumers!",
    "The experience of depression",
    "The filter I bought from another website before was not bad, and it was also not dirty after using it for 28 days.",
    "Because the things I bought from Amazon have always been good, I thought I would buy it here this time, and it was the first time I bought a filter from Amazon. I felt it was not good. Not only did it start to have water stains early on, but the filter was also floating with small black carbon powder after 28 days of use. I didn't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It was very frustrating.",
    "not as good as I expected.",
    "Compared with the plug-in boards I have used before, the external workmanship is general, and I have not disassembled the internal structure, but I hope it is as described by the store, from the convenience of use, whether each independent unit is powered or not is not displayed",
    "The package was damaged, so I waited for the time to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer packaging is damaged, the inner packaging seems to be new, but the instructions are not new, the house was renovated in September, and the goods were stored in the warehouse, I hope they will not be damaged when they are shipped, please explain why several customers mentioned that the packaging was damaged, but you were able to handle it safely, thank you!",
    "Overall, it's not bad, but there are some small problems.",
    "I bought a water filter pot for the first time, read a few reviews, and felt that LAICA had a better price/performance ratio, so I chose this one. When I received it, I installed the filter according to the instructions in the manual, and tried it out. Overall, it seemed okay, but when I poured water, it seemed that the original water mixed with the processed water at the mouth of the pot (the original water was not sealed tightly).",
    "When using, you must wait until all the water has been filtered before pouring it out!",
    "The picture is not complete.",
    "The picture does not show the details of the side, the side details are not consistent with the main style, there is a big difference, this is one; The pearl is made in Thailand, but there is no indication of the origin, this is the second; There is no indication of the soil, this is the third; When I bought it in the UK, it was clearly packaged in a box for each item, but here it is just a simple plastic bag, and there is",
    "Be careful when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon customer service is really good",
    "I ordered two days ago, and received it today, and found that the price was reduced by 40 yuan, and I spent a lot of time to find the customer service, and the customer service said that it could not be refunded, but it could be re-purchased and refunded.",
    "The customer service of this is really ten thousand times worse than that of somebodysomewhere.",
    "It's okay, as a newcomer, it's worth buying.",
    "The quality is acceptable, but it is not as good as the top-grade gold, I have seen the price of the mall, it is several hundred less, I am a newcomer to gold, it is okay.",
    "The goods are not bad.",
    "The item is not bad, I bought it for my girlfriend, but I was not very happy when I didn't pick up the package from Canada Post at noon, and the logistics company directly put the package in the mailbox and did not send me a message to confirm that the package was not picked up, so I had to go twice.",
    "But the baby is really good.",
    "worth buying",
    "The monkey is cute, Amazon's discount is really big, Chow Sang Sang's official website directly sent it, I ordered it last night, and I received it this afternoon, it's really fast.",
    "The postal express delivery man was also very responsible.",
    "Yes!",
    "A customer's confession",
    "1. Received such a defective product, Amazon customer service told you not to be in a hurry, we will contact you within 54 hours.",
    "Then you contact the customer service, they will tell you that there will be a specialist to deal with this problem, and he will tell you the result.",
    "You can never contact this staff directly, and you don't know her extension number, and there is no direct contact number, so you can't contact her, but she can contact you.",
    "The tragedy is that I waited for almost 3 days, and this specialist contacted me, but my phone was out of reach, and I didn't receive the call from this specialist.",
    "I waited 2 hours for the specialist to call me back, during which I contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service asking her to call me back.",
    "It's been nearly 3 days and I still don't know what Amazon is going to do about the coffee maker I received as a defective item!",
    "The US Amazon products are fine, but the shopping method is good, but the service is far worse than the US.",
    "For me, I can only continue to wait...",
    "The bottom line is not fair",
    "Because the reviews I read were all good, I was looking forward to this pan, and when I got it, I liked it because it was so light, but when I started cooking, I found the problem, the bottom of the pan was not flat, it was raised in the middle and sunk in around the edges, and the oil ran to the edges, so I couldn't cover the central area with the big fat pork I bought specifically for frying, it was a mess",
    "I don't know if it's my bad luck, I got a pot with a bottom that is not flat, fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it.",
    "I cleaned the pot and returned it, and I was busy for half a day.",
    "Good product design requires matching manufacturing skills to achieve",
    "This is a product with a very simple design style.",
    "The cube-like design, the designer has processed the top into a slightly curved surface.",
    "It should have been a very smooth line.",
    "Unfortunately, the final effect could not be achieved.",
    "Because the top has two parts, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.",
    "The radius of the lid and the control panel are not the same, and there is a height difference of up to 2mm when they are assembled.",
    "Although it looks like a very small gap.",
    "But it can be said that the whole design feeling has been destroyed.",
    "I feel a little sorry for the product designer.",
    "It seems that the product manager of the American company does not have the ability to make such a product.",
    "(The after-sales service lady\u2019s feedback is not required to be too high, but when I heard the after-sales service say that all the units of this product are like this, not just the one I bought, her indifferent and honest attitude made me understand that I cannot expect too much from Meizu) 2019-7-7 Water pump fault, the water output is insufficient, has been repaired twice, and the first repair was only",
    "It's very cheap after the discount, but I'm sad that the Amazon Prime Day discount is gone.",
    "I bought it for my baby a week after it was born, and it has a strong heating function.",
    "The pot is not hot on the outside, so it can effectively protect the temperature from escaping and will not burn people.",
    "The air conditioner can keep the room at a very high temperature even after a night.",
    "Amazon said there were 320 deals on Prime Day, but I found that everyone had 249,289,299, and I suddenly felt cheated, but I went to the supermarket and found that it was still more cost-effective than various brands at the same price, so I will take it with me when I go out in the future.",
    "Vitamix Vita-Mix 6300",
    "I've been looking at it for a long time, and when I saw the discount on the Nokia 6300, I bought it at the same price as the Middle East.",
    "I ordered on September 2nd, and it was expected to be delivered on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, which is about 10 days earlier, and the speed is really fast!",
    "The package is not big, and it is directly used with the original packaging of Vitamix. Amazon is not afraid of the damage caused by the fall of the package when it is shipped overseas!",
    "The machine looks quite new, and all the accessories are complete. The cup is very easy to shake on the base, and I am afraid that the cup will fly out when the machine is started!",
    "I asked a friend who paid 5200, and he said it was not so loose.",
    "The English recipe that comes with the machine is quite a hassle, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online, which is a hassle!",
    "After receiving the goods, I bought a transformer in a hurry. It should arrive in 3 days, then I will have a good time!",
    "It is too small, no umbrella, and the material is average.",
    "It's not a large size!",
    "The second Totes, 1. This one doesn't have a sleeve 2. The handle material is so-so 3. It says Large, but it's actually a compact umbrella that's convenient for one person to use, and I think it's enough for two people to use.",
    "In fact, the one I bought in America can accommodate three people without pressure.",
    "I don't think it's good.",
    "First, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms when you press it slightly. Second, the design of the flat surface of the back to prevent the ABS from scratching the surface of the box does not work. Third, the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around the handle, and the handle is prominent. There are many things that are not satisfactory, and the chain is not smooth.",
    "PS: The wheels feel really good.",
    "It can still be used.",
    "Advantages: This double shoulder bag is more refined, and it looks durable.",
    "Disadvantages: The 2D code on the card cannot be scanned (what is this), the 15.6 inch notebook cannot be put in (it can be a little longer), this backpack can be locked, but it does not prepare a lock for the buyer, it is not very service-oriented.",
    "The overall quality is okay, but I don't know if it's genuine leather.",
    "The overall feeling is okay, I don't know if it is genuine leather, so I can't make a random evaluation.",
    "It can hold A4 size documents, and 80 pages thick, but the box-shaped hard and thick (non-deformable) object is estimated to be unable to hold it.",
    "The bag is very soft, the inner bag is divided into a more humanized way, and it is still quite good.",
    "It's just that the bottom of the one I got has a small sand hole, is it because of my personality?",
    "I don't want to go back and forth to exchange, so I endured it.",
    "Overall, I would give it 4 stars, it is worth it.",
    "ForRoyal is popular all over the world, camera strap, single camera strap",
    "The design of this sling is more scientific. It is hung on the shoulders, practical, and the camera is fixed and protected by soft materials in the chest, not like other quick-shooting people who fix the bottom of the camera with screws, and it is very convenient to take down the camera.",
    "The after-sales service is rubbish",
    "I bought a piano half a month ago, and there is a missing part. After I notified Amazon, I was given the after-sales phone number. After multiple communication, the part is still not received, what is the efficiency!",
    "I guess it will be more troublesome to repair after the problem, I hope the after-sales friends will still go around, it's too troublesome!",
    "There are some small defects, but the sound is not bad.",
    "The piano has a defect, one corner is missing, it feels like a second-hand, but there is no gift, but the price is not bad, the piano's sound is also not bad.",
    "It's okay, the first one is the face sheet.",
    "Used for a long time, except that the low sound cannot come out, the overall is not bad.",
    "The workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.",
    "When I bought it for the first time, there were problems with the lights, they were flashing and couldn't be used.",
    "I asked for a refund, but it took three days for the money to arrive in Shanghai, and it still hasn't been delivered.",
    "They didn't even answer the phone when I called to arrange delivery.",
    "The courier company said that they only have that contact method.",
    "Amazon couldn't find a place to complain.",
    "They didn't ask for it, they just randomly delayed delivery - this is the text message I received.",
    "And then they said there was a problem with the transfer.",
    "I've had some terrible shopping experiences lately that have made me question the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.",
    "I don't think it will arrive today.",
    "The labels are not sticky enough and not waterproof",
    "Although Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface does not have a coating; the label adhesion is poor, and it is not suitable for use as cable labels, and it is very easy to fall off, so friends who buy it to organize the cables need to pay attention to it.",
    "The pen is fine, but the packaging is too simple, just a paper box, there is no protection measures, and the box for the pen is a big piece of transparent tape, and the tape is on the box, and if you tear it off, the tape is on the box.",
    "It is very disappointing to see how a 600 yuan item is treated.",
    "But the pen is fine.",
    "I hope they will improve the packaging in the future!",
    "I won't say anything about the quality, but if it comes to writing, I would rather choose 925-25.",
    "I would like to praise Tian Tian Kua Zhong for their fast delivery of aviation products, and their good service attitude!",
    "I have been using 925-25 for a long time, it is very good. I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not a problem, and the style is very beautiful. I gave it four stars because the pen is a bit heavy, which is not suitable for fast writing. The pen cap adjusts the length of the graphite core a bit shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more comfortable",
    "So I became an Amazon fanatic",
    "The price is very good, but the child does not like to write with the pen.",
    "It has been opened, I have applied for a refund, and it is free to pick up at the store.",
    "It's great.",
    "They don't recommend returns, but this kind of service is only available in China.",
    "I hope it won't be abused.",
    "I will buy the books in the future at this place.",
    "The headset has a bias and noise",
    "This headphone is really trash, I don't know if it's my ears or this headphone is really worse than before.",
    "I bought a blue one from JD.com two years ago, the sound quality is not bad, there is no noise, the low frequency is also not bad, I have used it for more than two years, and I plan to buy a new one (urbeats), because I still feel it is not bad.",
    "I saw a purple one that looked good, but when I bought it today and opened it, I felt that it was not right, the sound was big and small at the same time.",
    "At first I thought it was the sound effect of the song, but after listening for half a day, I found that the problem was very serious, not only the sound was biased, but also the low-frequency effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise, was this phenomenon only on the purple one I bought, or was the earphone manufacturing art really not good now?",
    "The reviews are quite poor, I'm very disappointed.",
    "I will definitely return it tomorrow morning.",
    "PS color is not bad",
    "This AV amplifier is complicated to set up, the workmanship is rough, and it gets hot easily.",
    "The sound quality needs to be evaluated after a period of use!",
    "I just bought the DN1080 in the German version on August 14th. The workmanship is not good.",
    "The front panel and knobs are all plastic.",
    "The rear panel audio input socket and speaker output terminal are not good, and a CD amplifier all-in-one machine with a price of 1000-2000 yuan is much better than this one.",
    "The top cover is relatively thin, and the transformer on my side is sunken, so I had to restore it by hand when I opened the box, and the top cover and the front panel are not well combined.",
    "The whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, and it is very awkward to move.",
    "It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just that workmanship, made in Malaysia.",
    "I feel that Sony should outsource production to China rather than Malaysia.",
    "5.The machine is hot, the temperature of the top cover is about 40-50\u00b0C after watching a movie for 2 hours, and I don't know if the transformer is too large and generates too much heat.",
    "Nowadays, most use switch power supply, this big transformer is estimated to be 4KG.",
    "Sony should use a quiet fan for active cooling inside the machine, but when you open the box, you only see a large aluminum heat sink on the pipe.",
    "Small treasure",

    "Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, I felt it was very soft, the quality is very good, I can't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ music.",
    "I was surprised, the sound quality was surround 3D!",
    "I asked in a physical communication store, it's about 30 yuan, but it's not a branded product, it's a random product, so I say that the price of this brand is 27 yuan, but the price-performance ratio is absolutely worth it!",

    "So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide the courier number, but they still haven't replied after two days.",
    "In the end, I called Amazon's customer service, and the customer service told me the seller's mobile phone number. I called the store again, and after several calls, the phone was connected, and I was told that the package had been delivered, and I could immediately ask for a new one.",
    "Although I was very angry, I didn't say much to the seller because the computer was very urgent, and I just wanted them to send it to me as soon as possible.",
    "The result is that I called the next day and asked if it had been shipped?",
    "The seller said it hadn't been sent yet, and it would be sent in the afternoon.",

    "Can you tell me the order number?",
    "The seller said it hadn't been sent, and told me to order it from another store if I was in a hurry, and it would be sent in the afternoon if I could wait.",
    "I can't, I have to order from another store and it will take a long time.",
    "All we can do is ask the seller to send it out as soon as possible.",
    "After countless phone calls, I finally received the computer on October 16th.",
    "As for the quality of the computer, I don\u2019t know, because it was bought for someone else, and I will add a comment later.",
    "I bought it half a year ago and used it a few times, but now it is not in contact with the touch screen, can it be repaired?",
    "Because I have a desktop, I have used it a few times after buying it.",
    "I only took it with me when I went on business trips.",
    "Recently, I found that it wouldn't charge when plugged in the power source, and I had to press the charger and the cable connection part with my hand several times to charge it.",
    "I suspect it's the interface, can it be repaired now?",
    "I strongly recommend Amazon to stop using EMS!",
    "The product is 5 stars, logistics is 1 star, and the average is 3 stars.",
    "I don't understand why Amazon needs to send EMS, which is not reliable in the industry, and a computer is also a valuable item!",
    "After buying, the order shows that it will be delivered on the 20th, so the family members at home waited for three days!",
    "From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why does it take 4-5 days?",
    "At 11am on the 22nd, the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, and I was very happy to receive the goods. However, in the evening, I didn't receive any calls or messages, and when I checked the logistics, I found that it had been signed at noon, and it was signed by myself!",

    "Who am I? Where am I? Is this really my computer?",
    "I really doubted if I was alive!",
    "Finally, I went to the pick-up point to pick up the computer.",
    "The specific reason is that the courier boy mixed up the two tracking numbers, and fortunately, the package was not lost.",
    "I strongly recommend that Amazon no longer use EMS. If Amazon uses EMS for shipping in the future, I will never buy from them again.",
    "The package is not bad",
    "First, I bought it a few days ago and found that it was cheaper, so I gave it a bad review. It was not bad, the price/performance ratio was high, the CPU and graphics card were sufficient to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-machine games, the cooling was very good, but the screen was a little bright (a common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality was not good, the hard disk was not good (I recommend that",
    "(By the way, I would like to remind you that if you want to buy a keyboard sticker, please do not go to the store of E Cool Digital Center in some Bao, the delivery is slow and the quality is poor, the product has problems and cannot be returned or exchanged, and the boss is full of dirty talk, I will expose it especially)",
    "The goods are good, but the platform official is still the same.",
    "The hard disk quality is very good, the price-performance ratio is absolutely high, it is cheaper to buy it than to buy it in Hong Kong, and it is absolutely recommended to buy it if you are not in a hurry and can bear the logistics.",
    "But it must be said that the officialdom of the Amazon platform is still the same, and it has not improved since I swore that I would never use it several years ago. You can never find out the actual logistics situation, and the information is always sent several weeks later, and it can never be returned, this is the officialdom!",
    "I have received the goods for several days, but the logistics information still says that you will receive the goods in 10 days!",
    "Logistics is careless",
    "It arrived in this state, not only was the packaging compressed, the packaging of the electrical appliance was also opened, and I don't know if they changed the packaging.",
    "FYI",
    "Haven't tried it yet, but I trust Philips, and hope the battery life is longer than others.",
    "I looked it up online, it's probably a common problem with water getting in, and there's no warranty.",
    "Depressed!",
    "Now I wrap it with plastic wrap and continue to use it, but I don't know how long it can be used?",
    "I bought one that had been opened by others",
    "The tax on 300+ machines is indeed quite high, but it's balanced out by the fact that I'll be getting 600+ now.",
    "When I received it, the seal was not good, it seemed to have been opened, I took a photo immediately, and it was torn open when I opened it, the paper inside was also damaged, I was afraid that someone else had returned it, I hurriedly gave it to my husband to try it before the anniversary, but the machine did not have any electricity, and I was glad that there was no beard in the blade, otherwise, how could I return it!",
    "Whether it is good to use or there will be any problems in the short term is unknown, as the reviews above said, the things that are sent out when there is a shortage are really not reliable!",
    "The experience is slightly above average",
    "It's almost top-level electric toothbrush, there are many kinds of clean teeth modes, but few people change the mode every day to brush their teeth.",

    "The brush head is just as cheap on Amazon.",
    "The app is a bit difficult to use, except for changing the color, the other compatibility issues seem to be due to the foreign version?",

    "1, The packaging is complete.",
    "2\u3001Use is very simple, cleaning is also very convenient.",
    "3. It can be DIYed, saving money.",
    "In summary, it was a very successful purchase.",
    "There are fake goods.",
    "I bought two packs last time, but they were two different versions. The left bottom corner of the packaging was originally green, but one of them was white, and the cat ate it and had diarrhea.",
    "I don't know whether the source of Amazon's goods is fake or the employee dropped the package when sending it.",
    "I will buy it again, if it is fake, I will find you responsible.",
    "It's the crossbars!",
    "The picture on Amazon is slanted, but the one I received is horizontal. Is this a scam?",

    "It's really important.\"",
    "Tight, narrow, ankle-binding, foot-binding.",

    "1.UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but this one is too bad.",
    "Addition: Today I compared the UN series shoes with the shoes of the UN series shoes before (the shoes were thrown away and the shoes were left), the material was much worse than before, the elasticity was not as good as before, and the breathability was not as good as before, it was just a fake soft.",

    "The next time I buy, the quality is not good.",
    "First, I have to say that the Prime overseas purchase Ups is powerful, and the order I placed on the 31st has already been received.",
    "The color of the shoes is better than the picture, and the leather feels good.",
    "The shoe size is a little larger, 25 feet long 10.5 wide 7.5W, the shoes are a little wider when worn, but I like to wear a little wider shoes, the shoes are just right.",
    "Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not good, one shoe has a damaged sole, the other shoe has various scratches and a needle hole, the sole and the upper are not well connected, and the glue strip is obviously misaligned!",
    "I regret it a little!",
    "I bought it for 280 yuan for activities, the price of ASICS is quite reasonable at this price, but I saw some reviews that the price is even lower.",
    "Now let's talk about the shoes. The advantages are: the shoes are very light, running is quite comfortable, and they fit well, they won't fall apart.",
    "The color is very high, but the disadvantage is very obvious: I usually wear 40 shoes, and this time I bought 40.5, and there is still about 1 thumb length from the front of the shoe to the foot, but it does not affect anything.",
    "This shoe is very \"narrow\", although there is still some distance in front, but it feels very tight.",
    "Another point, the shoes may not be very breathable, and now I feel my feet are hot.",
    "the heel is pressed",
    "First, the shoes are well made and worth the price.",
    "My feet are standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I have bought several pairs of Amazon's love step, never had a problem with the size, but these two I bought a size larger uk7, because the length is obviously longer after wearing, but because the shoe is too thick, the pressure on the back of the foot is very strong, and the hiking shoes are very hard, so it is very uncomfortable to",
    "If your feet are not very thin, I don't recommend buying this.",
    "If you have to buy, you can solve it by changing the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, it's a pity.",
    "A perfect purchase!",
    "I am very satisfied and very happy, I have no doubt that the products bought from Amazon overseas are genuine, the quality is also very good, the price is beautiful, I feel safe when I buy it, the after-sales service is very thoughtful, the attitude of the customer service is very friendly and considerate, the problem is patient and efficient, the problem is perfectly solved, the delivery is very convenient and safe, the delivery man is very considerate of the customer, and he",

    "When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn't connect with the ring, and both devices said they supported each other, but it was actually a problem with the heart rate band, because I couldn't connect with other devices either.",
    "I called Amazon and asked them to contact the agent, the agent asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.",
    "After nearly half a month, the things were sent back to me in the same package, and the package was the one I sent!",
    "No reply, no refund and no test report!",
    "Hello, at least tell me something, is it good or bad?",
    "I called to ask, and they said that sending it back like this means that the device is fine.",

    "The quality of the toy processing is not good",

    "Others said that it was easy to install, but was it only my purchase that had this problem?",
    "It's very common.",
    "Is it because of my bad luck?",
    "The packaging is old and worn out; the workmanship is very ordinary; the music is only one kind and only 8 seconds long, then it repeats over and over again; the action is just shaking the head of the toy to make it walk forward, with no variation at all.",
    "Not worth this price.",
    "I was in a hurry, so I didn't return it.",
    "The quality of the toy is not bad, but I have to complain about the packaging.",
    "I received the express yesterday, bought from Amazon, marked as EMS, and finally delivered by Tianma Express, how many turns? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tianma Express not good?",
    "I'll say it again about the packaging, it's just wrapped in a few layers of preservation film, there's no packaging plastic bubble paper inside, when you open it, all the parts are in a very empty box, the toy quality is not bad, there are no broken parts, but it's smaller than imagined, because it doesn't have a battery, it's easy to slip when you push it by hand, and the track is too wide, the",

    "I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch was checked for time when it was put into stock. They replied \"yes\", so why is the time so different, it must be a watch with poor accuracy, simply put, it is a rubbish product, I am not saying this to be difficult to understand, look, it is very obvious that there is a quality problem (the numbers are not displayed completely).",
    "I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and also complained that they should not buy their things, this kind of product, this kind of seller, this kind of after-sales service, in the future who still dares to buy things on Amazon.",

The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it is also imported mechanical core. It has a certain value, which cannot be compared with the so-called mechanical watches for 300-400 yuan. This is a genuine product.",
    "The watch's timekeeping is very accurate, and the error is completely within an acceptable range. The watch comes with a gemstone appraisal certificate, and the 12 characters on the watch dial are real diamonds. It is very suitable for me to wear it, and it is also very face-saving to give it as a gift.",
    "The Beneli watch is indeed not bad.",
    "The worst shopping experience in history",
    "On the evening of September 23, my wife's mobile phone was dropped, and I suddenly bought a watch from Malaysia Amazon for 8p, which was delivered but not self-operated and without additional charges (I was secretly happy), because it was not self-operated, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the latest delivery time was expected to be September 27.",
    "My wife was without a phone and was suffering, so she called me at 6:30 the next morning to think of a way to get a phone, and then I saw that there was a 256G phone that could be delivered to Beijing the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.",
    "I bought a new one, and I wanted to cancel the order from Amazon as soon as possible.",
    "Because the order was placed at midnight, it was impossible to receive the courier in the morning, so I called the customer service at 7:30 to cancel the order, and the customer service said that the order had been cancelled and was waiting for the SMS notification.",
    "OK, I will wait patiently. At noon, I checked my phone and found that the order was still in the status of not shipped. I immediately contacted the customer service to cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service replied that the operation was successful.",
    "At 3pm, I checked my phone and found that the order was still there. I couldn't do anything but call the customer service again to tell them that I had called them for the third time, and asked them to cancel the order and tell the seller not to send the goods!",

    "When I looked at the order on Monday, I found that it had been shipped, and I was speechless.",
    "Because I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call the customer service again.",
    "The following handling was speechless, basically I said one step, and the customer service operated it for a while.",
    "The order is still in the state of delivery refusal, and is preparing to be sent again!",
    "Amazon should not be passive, right?",
    "The seller's company has received the money, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.",
    "In summary, I will never pay in advance for large items again, this is too troublesome.",
    "looks very good",
    "I had my eyes on this camera for a long time, but I didn't buy it because of some other reasons besides the price, but this time I bought it because of the free shipping, and the price is also acceptable.",
    "After buying it, there are no other problems, but when connecting the software, it can't connect no matter what, my home is TP router, after searching the Internet, I found that many people have this problem, it took me two hours to change the router settings, and I used 360WIFI as a medium to make it work, I called the Mi customer service during the period, and they also had no solution to this problem, so they just let me contact",
    "Another point worth noting is that I saw users\u2019 comments online that this camera only supports storage cards with a minimum capacity of 8G, and it cannot recognize storage cards with smaller capacities, so please pay attention to this.",
    "It feels okay to use it, the screen is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, and the machine has a certain degree of heat, and if it is always open, the degree of heat is a bit difficult to accept.",
    "In summary, this product has many shortcomings, so please be careful when buying.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because it was my first love and I had been using it for almost 3 years, but it suddenly left me last year and I still miss it.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because I bought it as my first love, and I don't know how much I used it now, maybe I should throw it away!",
    "Have been together for almost 3 years, and she left me last year, and now when I think of her, I feel like I want to leave this world, the first woman in my life, has given me a lifetime of shadow and pain, and I still can't get out of it.",
    "When I bought this phone, I thought of the two feelings at that time, and I still feel that we can bear each other's burdens, but now I can't bear to look back, and maybe life is like this, some people don't want to meet for their whole life, and some things don't want to know for their whole life, but what can I do?",
    "Every time I see a Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain comes flooding back, filling me up. I have never regretted spending more than 2000 yuan on a phone, but I didn't hesitate to buy it for her, no matter how much I loved her, but if she ever changed her mind, all the promises would be for nothing.",
    "The best of the domestic brand",
    "Huawei is a high-end product of China.",
    "The low-key CEO and the company rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current trend of raising awareness through advertising!",
    "Companies without strength can never do this, and they would never dare to do this!",
    "That's why I chose Huawei.",
    "I have been using it for more than half a year, and I feel it is very good.",
    "The reason for not giving a full score is that once when using its offline navigation, it showed a problem of not being able to locate, and I finally couldn't find the reason, but it was good in other times.",
    "And it is very convenient to input the destination online and automatically design the route after searching. When it is offline navigation after leaving wifi, it can automatically navigate, and it can directly communicate with the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation without running traffic, which is very good!",
    "Sony is great",
    "The low-end machine of Sony still has a strong sense of design, and the price is cheap, the screen is big, the battery life is excellent, and it is very suitable for the elderly.",
    "Although a lot of time has passed, this machine still has no problems.",
    "However, because my Z2 was dropped, this phone also completed its mission."
