    "People with thick earwax might be more strict.",
    "I should have bought the one without a handle.",
    "that's terrible.",
    "The design is good but it's too big to hold. Will it be less effective if I attach it to my foot?",
    "It's winter, so it's cold in the east...",
    "As other reviews have mentioned, the cable is only 110x80mm and is not vertically oriented.",
    "I bought it because I wanted to warm up the whole quilt, but it's more expensive than a spread type, but it's big, but I don't think there's anything wrong with it, but I can't check it out in the store like a famous brand, so I guess I have no choice.",
    "The only way to use it is to combine it with the N warm and the dory.",
    "By the way, the quality of the fur is out of the question.",
    "it's going well.",
    "It's small but has enough wind.",
    "The battery is also interchangeable and can be used as a backup.",
    "If you put it on a table and adjust the angle, it will be better if you do it like the picture.",
    "It will fly off the table if you blow on it, but it's fine if you put a handkerchief on it.",
    "Sound is not noticeable when using it outside/family, but it is too loud when using it in an office, even when using the \u201cmiddle\u201d setting.",
    "It's necessary to make a distinction between the child you have when you're out and about and the child you have at home.",
    "Also, when I use it in the office, it's too cold even when I set it to \"small\".",
    "It's great for running into a Family Mart to cool off after sweating a lot at the front of the race.",
    "Just one, when you put it in your bag, sometimes the power button gets pressed and you don't know it and it just keeps spinning.",
    "It would be nice if there were some effort put into things like slightly pulling in the button (sinking it) or making the first press a long press.",
    "In a time of dangerous heat, it's an essential item, so I'd appreciate it if you could make a better one.",
    "Multifunctional light speaker",
    "I put the weakest warm color in it and use it in the bedroom.",
    "it's better than I thought!",
    "I'm glad I bought it.",
    "As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color by touch.",
    "The white color goes with any room and the color light changes with gradation, so it is beautiful.",
    "Also, it will stop at your favorite color when you touch it in your favorite color, so you can change the color to match your mood!",
    "It's an LED, so it's expected to have a long lifespan.",
    "I think the audio quality is more than enough for my amateur ears.",
    "Another great thing about this light is that it is very versatile.",
    "The top has a large speaker attached.",
    "It can be paired with a mobile phone or Bluetooth, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.",
    "If you pair your mobile phone, you can make hands-free calls.",
    "Also, it is compatible with MicroSD, so you can connect it to a computer and use it as an mp3 player to play music.",
    "Practice and piano practice",
    "At 66 years old, I've started trying DTM to prevent choking.",
    "Buy an audio interface and a microphone.",
    "At first I was just punching it in, but I got hooked on playing the piano and I practice every day.",
    "I downloaded the bundled audio source but the protection didn't work so I downloaded ASIO at first but I'm using this free piano source for piano practice because it has a good sound.",
    "I think I made a good purchase.",
    "I feel like I've been tricked by the looks.",
    "Is there a product that is not a match?",
    "It's a long read.",
    "The foam on my 4-5 year old Doshisha-made office chair (bouncing armrests) has deteriorated and is now all lumpy, so I'm considering buying a non-foam bouncing armrest chair.",
    "I went to home centers and furniture stores, but I couldn't find anything that fit.",
    "I have some reservations about buying this without seeing it in person, but I'm willing to compromise on the look and price to buy it on Amazon.",
    "The box is surprisingly light and compact.",
    "There is one spare nut.",
    "[Attention] The attached hex wrench and screwdriver are very greasy.",

    "It took 40 minutes to complete the assembly.",
    "I'm done, let me check the product.",
    "The jumping style armrests have different stiffness when raised and lowered left to right, and the left is heavy when raised and lowered, and the right is light, and the armrests are not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).",
    "The adjustable angle of the headrest on a mobile headrest is weak, so it falls down with a \"click\" sound as soon as you tilt it.",
    "The seat feels hard because of the non-recycled high-density urethane foam, and it's not very comfortable to sit on (is the resilience weak?",
    ") The mesh back part of the competition mesh is harder than other mesh chairs, and it hurts your back if you wear a thin shirt.",
    "Small detail, but the height from the seat to the ground is 530, not 550 (height is important for tall people), and the foot part that supports the caster is not made of steel, so there is a question about durability.",
    "I bought a new cushion and put a towel under the mesh part because it seems to wear out (get damaged) quickly.",
    "I feel like the 186cm 80kg me only feels the back fit, but the rest of the fit is not satisfactory, and I feel like it is a product that is off the mark.",
    "I think it would be better to try it out in person and sit in it before buying.",
    "I got an email from the manufacturer welcoming me to Amazon, should I ask about the armless and headless ones?",
    "Under consideration.",
    "Well, what is this?",
    "My home environment seems to be right for the right-handed BS4K, so I bought a cheap Pixel 4K tuner without much expectation.",
    "As an experiment, I can see the free rotation to the right starting with NHK BS4K, and it looks great on the Panasonic 4K TV I bought at the same time.",
    "(Sometimes the picture freezes up) I bought it and got an update right away and it now records, so I\u2019m trying out a few recordings, but I wonder if the external 2.5 inch HDD affects it, because the picture freezes during playback or the frame skips.",
    "The user interface is not praised at all and is just \"can see 4K broadcasts\".",
    "By the way, when recording, you can only rewind the recording of that program, and I also accept this as a plus feature that you can record 4K on the HDD.",
    "You might be tempted to buy a lot of things you're looking forward to, but don't get too excited.",
    "I hope it will be improved in the next update.",
    "the heating function is OK.",
    "I haven't used the warming function yet, but when I put in 2 500ml pet bottles, it warmed up in about 2 hours and was hot after 2.5 hours.",
    "I have it installed in the footwell of the passenger seat of my compact car and it is fine when idling but I don't notice it at all when driving.",
    "It was new so it had that chemical smell that fans were used to, so I had to open the windows regularly to air it out.",
    "As the review says, the shoulder strap buckle is a pain in the ass, so you need to bend the buckle to make it work with minus drivers.",
    "it's really fragile.",
    "I bought it two months ago and it suddenly broke.",
    "I loved the feel and size of it but it's not worth it if it breaks.",
    "I work all day on a PC editing videos, but the volume suddenly goes up to 100%.",
    "It will be back to 100% in no time.",

    "And it also interferes with the mouse, so you have to turn off the keyboard every time you want to use the mouse.",
    "The enter and backspace keys no longer work.",
    "I would not recommend it at all, but if it's only 1000 yen, you might as well try it.",
    "If you're lucky, you might be able to use the half year rank.",
    "Other brands have the same price range but only 6 months warranty.",
    "The short warranty period tells the story of how fragile it is.",
    "The product is the best, the packaging is the worst.",
    "I love using this in different colors.",
    "I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a food stocker!!",
    "However, there was a huge gap between the large ball and the product, and the invoice was not included and the packaging was the worst.",
    "The lid was out of the box when I opened it.",
    "I recommend this, but you might be better off buying it elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the strength, but for now",
    "I bought it because the support was no longer acceptable where I bought the cover.",
    "It does its job in terms of stability, but it's a fancy plastic product, so if you're not careful when opening and closing the lid, it makes a \"clack, clack\" sound that's annoying.",
    "You need to choose the right thickness of the shingles when you buy them, so be careful.",
    "Meatballs are cute back",
    "I was looking for a backpack for my dog to take on walks and was drawn to this sleek gray one, so I bought it.",
    "It's a folding style, and it's surprisingly lightweight, so it doesn't feel heavy when you hold it.",
    "The snaps move smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "It looks like it will be comfortable for long trips.",
    "It's very compact and easy to fold up.",
    "Even when folded, the meatball design is visible, and it's cute when you put it away.",
    "It's light and comfortable!",
    "The skateboard is also fun to ride around.",
    "First, I was attracted by its appearance and price, so I bought it right away.",
    "I love my TSA lock, I have a few, they are so convenient.",
    "And for a master of lost keys and misplaced items, I recommend Numberlock.",
    "But honestly, I put the most importance on the lightness, but if you want durability or security, the zipper will be a weak point, it will tear apart in a week if you cut it with a knife.",
    "Also, the zipper needs to be sewn together carefully because the fabric is soft.",
    "If you're traveling abroad, I recommend bringing it on the plane.",
    "I used it for a shinkansen trip and it was comfortable.",

    "I thought it was small at first but it grew on me.",
    "This time, ML574, my sister said it was small at 24.5cm and I was able to make it work, it was indeed small.",
    "It felt like I was touching my pinky.",
    "So I bought a 25cm.",
    "when you open it, it's huge...",
    "I tried them on and they were a little loose even with the insoles in.",
    "I was thinking about returning it but it was a bit small at 24.5 so I'm going to leave it as is and wear it at 25.",
    "I bought team red and it is a very bright red and it is great!",
    "With all the monochrome clothing, you'll be brightening up the place!",
    "165cm, 40s male.",

    "Height: 165cm  Weight: 60kg  Waist: 81cm  Hip circumference: 100cm  Typical metabolic abdomen.",
    "<Use> In the water, the waist part is soft, and the rush guard is flipped up.",
    "I'm swimming while fixing the part that was flipped up.",
    "Especially when you slack off on the Jaggies, your metabolism is in a good state.",
    "Also, when you walk, bending your hips up and down, it will inevitably roll up.",
    "<Product> The fabric is thick enough and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about the nipple showing through.",
    "At this price point, I am satisfied with this product, but I think the smaller size would fit better.",
    "It was a gas leak, as I suspected...",
    "Silver cult 25 still leaks gas, when I changed the valve I had a problem where part of the tank was missing, but when I used a vacuum to seal the tank and do the repair I was able to shoot it fine, if you want to buy this cult 25, find someone who can take it apart and put it back together, or take pictures while taking it apart and don\u2019t have the confidence to do it yourself, I don\u2019t recommend it,",
    "I thought it would be a pretty good quality for 188 yen",
    "You can use early dismissal and turk to your advantage.",
    "I like it to be light and small, and above all, simple without any embellishment.",
    "There's no rubber stopper when you attach the bit, and I thought it was a surprising cost for 188 yen.",
    "It depends on how long it lasts.",
    "I don't think it's used enough to warrant a spot in the toolbox, but it's still a good tool.",
    "I bought this along with the same seller's \"1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release driver bit holder 60/100/150 mm\"",
    "No problem at all, and I thought the price was very reasonable.",
    "the controller stops working.",
    "The player's own aircraft will move on its own and cannot be controlled.",
    "If you disconnect and reconnect the cable, it will work, but after a few minutes, the drone will move in a direction it shouldn't and you won't be able to control it.",
    "I would not buy this.",
    "I'm warning you all.",
    "It's a cool product.",
    "It's wired, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable and has lasted a long time even though I've been using it for a long time.",
    "It can also be used for PC games.",
    "...  I think it was good that I was able to get a refund of the Amazon gift card as a defective item within a month.",
    "Will this increase the computing power?",
    "I think it's for kids who understand the math.",
    "Is it impossible for a child who doesn't understand calculations?",
    "I can't solve the problem.",

    "Maybe it's easy for people who are used to DS?",
    "I can't help but like the illustrations of manga characters, or maybe it's because I'm drawn in by the fun of the screen, but I can't help but like it.",
    "The way the calculations are done is also done in a way that competes with time, for example, how many questions can be answered correctly in how many minutes.",
    "I understand the need to rush you for the exams, but can't you just make them anxious enough to make them calculate?",
    "The bell ringing when it's over is also something I don't like for some reason.",
    "I've been working hard all my life, but wouldn't it be nice to have a more pleasant sound?",
    "I feel like I lost 6,200 yen.",
    "I would understand if it was half the price.",

    "Just listening makes me feel better!",
    "I was moved to tears when I first saw the characters from Persona 3 in HD for the first time.",
    "Somehow, I think Shunpei looks like a handsome guy (laugh). Persona 5 is already beautiful, so there's no freshness to it... That's why I think 3 is more worth it.",
    "As a music game, I felt 5 was more fun than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is blue-themed, but it was hard to see against a dark background.",
    "The main colors are bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it's against a background.",
    "With all the assist features, I think even someone who's bad at rhythm games can play it.",
    "Turning on the challenge function in a rhythm game might make it a teeth grinder for a dedicated player.",

    "that's too bad.",
    "I bought this because I liked the color of the letters in the picture but the actual product is blue and it's more like black or charcoal gray.",
    "And it wasn't a double back roll.",
    "I was thinking of buying gold too, but I haven't decided yet. It's cheap, so should I give up?",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange the item for a new one after the review was posted.",
    "The rest of the process was quick.",
    "I think the support was great even though it was a cheaper product.",
    "Four stars for response  Addendum:  Gold was also purchased.",
    "The colors are almost like a picture and are very beautiful.",
    "But it's clear that the buckle is not a double lock, unlike the explanation picture.",
    "That's too bad.",
    "It's going to get really heavy in the evening.",
    "I used it on a SIM-free iPhone 7s.",
    "At first, I couldn't figure out what to do after arriving in Korea and pointing the SIM card, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Incheon Airport and she showed me (Settings > Mobile Communication > Communication Options, turn on data roaming).",
    "The lecture that came with the product didn't seem to have much to do with it...?",
    "However, the area around Kobe Airport has been suffering from poor radio waves, and 3G has been unavailable for a long time.",
    "When I went to the city, it became 4G.",
    "Sometimes the traffic got really heavy in the evening or at night, and I think it might have reached a maximum of several hundred MBs per day.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I used SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim free and used it on Ymobile, but since Z4 was not doing well, I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that can be used with a SIM card for the first time, so I bought it.",
    "I was worried that it wouldn't work properly since I was using a mobile Suica, but it worked perfectly fine.",
    "It looks like an iPhone 6 because of its size, weight, and silver color.",
    "I don't play games so the speed is the same as the Z4, but it feels a little faster.  I read a review that said the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so I use face recognition instead.",
    "I thought it was amazing, just like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase, even though I upgraded to Android version 9.",
    "I have a few things I'd like to mention  It's a little smaller than I expected  It doesn't have a strap hole  *It can be adapted to a case with a strap hole  I haven't tested it for waterproofness yet  It's a little heavy  I haven't used it much yet but I'm satisfied with it  I recommend it"
