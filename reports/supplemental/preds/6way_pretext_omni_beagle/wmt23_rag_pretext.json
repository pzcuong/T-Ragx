    "As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color with a touch.",
    "The white color is suitable for any room, and the color light is also gradual, so it is beautiful.",
    "Also, when you touch your favorite color, it stops at your favorite color, so you can light it up according to your mood!",
    "It's LED so it's expected to last a long time.",
    "As for sound quality, I think it's a good enough level for my amateur ears.",
    "Another great thing about this light is that it is very versatile.",
    "- The top has a large speaker.",
    "It can pair with your mobile phone via Bluetooth, so you can enjoy wireless music.",
    "- If you pair it with your mobile phone, you can also use hands-free calling.",
    "- Also, it is compatible with MicroSD, so it can be connected to a computer and used as an mp3 player to play music.",
    "Inserting and practicing the piano",
    "At 66 years old, I started to challenge DTM for the sake of preventing varicose veins.",
    "I bought the audio interface and the instrument.",
    "At first I was practicing inputting, but I got stuck on piano playing, so I practice every day from morning to night.",
    "I downloaded the supplied sound source, but the protection didn't work, so at first I downloaded ASIO, but I found that the free piano sound source has a good sound, so I use it for piano practice.",
    "I think it was worth it.",
    "I feel like I was deceived by the appearance.",
    "Is there a product that fits your needs?",
    "usually these questions take the form of a superlong paragraph",
    "I'm considering buying a non-synthetic leather office chair with a rocking base because the synthetic leather on my Doshisha office chair (rocking base) has deteriorated and become sticky.",
    "I've looked at home centers and furniture stores, but I can't find the right thing.",
    "I was worried because I couldn't check the actual product, but I compromised on the design and price and bought this product on Amazon.",
    "The box is surprisingly light and compact.",
    "I have one spare leg.",
    "[Note] The hex key and nuts are oily.",
    "At first, the oil was sticking to the wrench and I was worried that the body was going to be stained.",
    "It took me 40 minutes to assemble.",
    "Completed and checked the product.",
    "The armrests have different stiffness when you push them up and down, and when you push them up and down, the left one is heavy and the right one is light, making the armrests difficult to use (there is no way to adjust them).",
    "The adjustable headrest angle adjustment is weak and falls down with a \"click\" sound.",
    "The seat is made of non-recyclable high-density polyurethane foam and feels hard, making it uncomfortable to sit on (is it not elastic?",
    ") The backrest part of the competition mesh is harder than the mesh chairs of other companies, and it is thin, so it hurts the back.",
    "There are some small things, the height from the seat to the ground was 530mm, not 550mm (the height of the seat is important for tall people), and the part that supports the caster is not made of steel, so there is a question about durability.",
    "I bought a separate cushion and put a towel on the mesh part because it seems to wear out (get damaged) quickly.",
    "As a 186cm/80kg person, I felt that the fit of the back was good, but overall I think it's a product with low satisfaction, and it's a product that I feel like I'm always hitting something.",
    "In the end, it might be better to go to an office chair store and try it out before buying.",
    "I got an email from the manufacturer with a welcome message from Amazon, so I'm going to ask about the armrests and headrests.",
    "yeah,i'm weighing things.",
    "Well, what do you expect for this kind of thing.",
    "I bought the cheaper Pixel 4K tuner, as I could see that the right rotating BS4K would be visible in my living room, and I didn't have high expectations.",
    "As an experiment I'm also watching the free right-hand rotation of BS4K and it looks great on the Panasonic 4K TV I bought at the same time.",
    "(Sometimes the picture goes all blocky)  I've just updated it and it's now recording compatible so I've set a few recordings to watch but I'm wondering if the external 2.5\" HDD is causing issues as it's stuttering on playback, freezing the picture and skipping frames.",
    "The user interface is far from praiseworthy and is just a way to get to the \"watch 4K broadcasts\" option.",
    "For the record, I feel that when you're recording something, you can only rewind and play it, so I'm also accepting this as a plus point that you can record 4K to the HDD.",
    "You might be disappointed if you buy it expecting a lot, so don't have too high expectations.",
    "I hope they will improve it with updates.",
    "The heating function is OK",
    "I haven't used any other functions yet, but I put in two 500ml bottles and it took about 2 hours to warm up and about 2.5 hours to get really hot.",
    "I used it in the footwell of the passenger seat of a compact car, and the fan noise is noticeable when it's idle, but I don't notice it at all when it's running.",
    "Still new so there is a chemical smell coming from the fan which is a bit concerning and I had to open the window for ventilation.",
    "As another reviewer has said, the screws that go through the shoulder strap are really bad, you need to bend the negative driver to get them out.",
    "they're just so, so delicate.",
    "I started using it today and it broke after 2 months.",
    "I liked the feel of the keys and the size, but it's useless if it breaks.",
    "I use my PC all day for video editing work and the volume just randomly goes to 100%.",
    "Even if you turn it down, it will go back to 100% in a moment.",
    "The headphones hurt my ears and I can't use them, and at night I can't use the PC because the volume is too loud.",
    "The volume display keeps appearing and disappearing on the PC screen as if it's sending a signal every few seconds.",
    "It also interferes with the mouse commands, so you have to turn the keyboard off every time you use the mouse.",
    "The enter key and backspace key also stopped working.",
    "I would not recommend it at all, but if it's only 1000 yen, you might as well try it.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use it for half a year.",
    "Other brands in the same price range offer 1-3 years warranty, but this one only offers 6 months.",
    "The short warranty period tells you it's not durable.",
    "The product is good, but the packaging is the worst.",
    "I love the product, and it's my favorite, even though it's a different color.",
    "I would definitely recommend Food Storage to anyone looking for it!",
    "However, there is a gap where the large cardboard box is rolled up and down with the groceries, and the packaging was the worst.",
    "The lid was also out of the box when I opened it.",
    "I would recommend the product but I think it would be better to buy it from somewhere else.",
    "I'm worried about the strength, but I'll try it anyway",
    "I bought it because the lid was replaced and the support was not good enough.",
    "The lid does its job of being stable, but it's a fancy plastic product, so when you open and close the lid, if you're not careful, it makes a \"creaky, (looks like it's going to break)\" sound.",
    "You need to choose something that matches the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when buying.",
    "I like the back with the cute paw print",
    "I was looking for a backpack to take my dog out and I was attracted to this cool gray backpack so I bought it.",
    "It is a build-it-yourself type and when I held it, I was surprised at how light it was, so it didn't feel heavy when I held it.",
    "The fasteners move smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "It looks like it will be comfortable even for long trips.",
    "It's very compact and easy to fold up.",
    "Even when folded, the paw design is visible and it looks cute when placed.",
    "Light and comfortable!",
    "The pulleys are also very smooth and easy to use.",
    "First of all, I was attracted to its appearance and low price at first sight, so I bought it right away.",
    "I have a few other favorites that I've had for a few years now, but this one is so convenient.",
    "And as a celebrity of key loss and misplacement, I recommend the number lock.",
    "However, to be honest, I think the most important point is the lightness, but it's good, but if you want durability and security, the screw part is very loose after a week, and it can be cut with a knife because it's fabric, so it will break in an instant.",
    "Also, the fastener part is soft and I wish there was some kind of reinforcement there.",
    "If you are traveling overseas, I recommend you to bring it on board.",
    "I used it on the Shinkansen and it was comfortable.",
    "Size is difficult to choose...",
    "Because of the wide range, it's hard to buy shoes.",
    "The toe and heel are 24cm.",
    "MRL996 also 24cm.",
    "I thought they were small at first, but once I got used to them, they're fine.",
    "The ML574 I bought this time was a bit tight when my sister said 24.5cm was too small and I had to wear it, but it was really tight.",
    "It felt like my little finger was touching.",
    "So I bought the 25cm.",
    "When it arrived and I opened it, it was big...",
    "When I put them on, they are a bit loose even with socks on.",
    "I was thinking about returning them, but if they are too small at 24.5, it would be a hassle, so I will try wearing them with inserts at 25.",
    "I bought the team red and it's really good with the fresh red!",
    "This is great for wearing with black or white monotone outfits as it brightens up the look!",
    "Male, 40s, 165cm",
    "I ordered the L size, but I recommend the M size for those who are similar to the below specs.",
    "Height: 165cm  Weight: 60kg  Waist: 81cm  Belly: 100cm  Typical metabolic belly.",
    "<Usage> Underwater, the waist part is loose because of the rush guard, so it flaps.",
    "I swim with it, adjusting the part that rides up.",
    "Especially when I'm wearing a bikini, my metabolic belly is very visible.",
    "Also, if I walk around a lot and move up and down a lot, it still ends up sagging down.",
    "<Product Quality> The fabric is sturdy and not thin, so I don't worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "At this price, I am satisfied with the quality, but I think it would be better to buy a smaller size.",
    "I guess I leaked gas again...",
    "Silver Colt 25 was leaking gas again, I replaced the valve and it caused a problem where part of the tank was missing, I used the [Bushwacker Q] to seal the tank and then did the glue gun repair and it's back to normal, I would recommend this Colt 25 to anyone who can take it apart and put it back together, I'm not sure I can recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the",
    "i thought 188 yen, what quality is this",
    "You can use it for quick turns and torque.",
    "It's light and small, and most importantly, it has a simple design without any decoration.",
    "There's no screws to attach the bit either, so I thought it was a great bargain at 188 yen.",
    "And that's about it for durability.",
    "I don't think I'll use it very often, but I think it's a good thing to keep in the toolbox.",
    "I bought it from the same seller as \"1/4 inch square magnetic quick release driver bit holder 60/100/150 mm\"",
    "No issues with this one either, in fact I think it was great value for money.",
    "the controller stops moving",
    "The drone will move on its own and you won't be able to control it.",
    "If you reconnect the cable, you can operate it, but after a few minutes, the drone will move in the wrong direction and you won't be able to operate it.",
    "I would not buy this product.",
    "I'm just warning everyone.",
    "It's a bad product.",
    "It's wired, but I'd recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable, and I've been using it for a long time and it hasn't broken yet.",
    "You can use it for PC games too.",
    "Update: I returned it as a defective item within 1 month and got my Amazon gift card refunded, so I think it was good at that time.",
    "Does this increase the computational power?",
    "I think it's for kids who understand calculations.",
    "Is it not possible without a child who can understand calculations to some extent?",
    "The problems are too hard.",
    "Also, when you have to show the tools to the parents, you have to point at the screen and raise it up, but I tried it myself and it doesn't work smoothly no matter how many times you do it.",
    "I guess it depends on whether you can easily show it to someone who is familiar with DS?",
    "I can't get into drawing comic characters, and I think it's because DS and such have a certain charm to the screen... I don't know why I can't get into it.",
    "The way of calculating is also competing with time, such as how many questions can you answer correctly in a certain number of minutes.",
    "I understand that they want you to hurry up in exams... but why do they make you calculate in a hurry?",
    "The gong that sounds when you finish also doesn't appeal to me.",
    "Why can't they change it to a more pleasant sound even though they're working hard?",
    "This makes 6,200 yen feel like a loss.",
    "I understand the half price, but...",
    "sorry, i translated it like this \u2606 and it became two.",
    "Persona songs are good!",
    "I got to the ED of Persona 3.",
    "I played up to 5.",
    "I've completed Persona 4 on vita.",
    "The things you can do are the same as in the previous Persona 4.",
    "It feels shorter than the previous one because there's no story.",
    "The music is still great!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "The characters from Persona 3 were HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I first saw them.",
    "Somehow, Junpei looks like an ikemen (lol), Persona 5 is already beautiful, so it's fresh...... If you think that way, then 3 is a better deal.",
    "As for the music, I felt that it was easier to play than in 3.",
    "Persona 3 has a lot of blue, but the backgrounds were too dark to see.",
    "5 has bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it blends with the background.",
    "It has a lot of assist functions, so I think even people who are bad at audio can play it.",
    "For those who are good at music, it may become a game that is challenging to play with the challenge function turned on.",
    "The triple pack includes Santa Rosa, but it's not just a bonus, it's a full 4-pack, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this.",
    "what?!",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face on the photo, but the actual product is blueish, not black or chocolate brown.",
    "And it wasn't double buckle.",
    "I was thinking of buying gold too but I'm holding off for now, I'm not sure if I'll give up because it's cheap.",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange for a new one after the review was posted.",
    "The rest of the process was also quick.",
    "I think they handled it very well, even though it was a cheap product.",
    "Response with 4 stars  Addendum: I also bought the gold.",
    "The colour is almost exactly as in the photo and it is very nice.",
    "But it's clear that the buckle doesn't double lock as in the description photo.",
    "That's the only downside.",
    "It gets really heavy in the evening.",
    "I used it with a SIM-free iPhone 7s.",
    "The first time, I didn't know what to do after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport (set > mobile communication > communication options > turn on data roaming), and it worked.",
    "The included manual didn't seem to be very relevant...?",
    "However, around Gimpo airport, the signal was bad, so I was only able to use 3G.",
    "When I went out into the city, it switched to 4G.",
    "In the evening and at night, sometimes the communication became very heavy, but I think I reached the maximum of a few hundred MB a day.",
    "better than i thought",
    "I've been using the SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, and I've made it sim-free and used it with Ymobile, but since the Z4 was getting old, I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that I can use with a new au phone, so I bought it.",
    "I was using Mobile Suica, so I was worried if it would work properly, but there was no problem at all.",
    "The size, weight, and silver color make it look like an iPhone6?",
    "I don't play games so the processing speed is the same as Z4, just a little faster impression  In the review, it was said that the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so I use face recognition which is faster.",
    "I thought it was great that it looked like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with Android Ver9, so I was able to make a purchase that I was satisfied with.",
    "What I don't like:  A little smaller would be better  No strap hole *This can be solved with a case with a strap hole  I haven't tested water resistance  It's a little heavy  I'm satisfied with it even though I haven't used it much, I recommend it"
