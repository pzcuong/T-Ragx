The first chapter is about the faith and history of Mount Hayachine, and the second chapter is about the German geologist Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), who built the foundation of Japanese geology, and the features of Mount Hayachine seen from the perspective of geology, with a focus on the surveys conducted by Naumann and others.",

    "it's going to be a long one.",
    "I've been using a Doshisha-made office chair (with a lift-up armrest) for about 4-5 years, and the synthetic leather has deteriorated and become wrinkled, so I'm considering buying a non-synthetic leather chair with a lift-up armrest.",
    "I've been looking at home centers and furniture stores but nothing is right.",
    "I was a little nervous about not being able to see the actual product, but I compromised on the design and price and bought it on Amazon.",
    "The product boxes are surprisingly light and compact.",
    "There is one spare screw.",
    "Note: The included hex wrench and screws are oily.",
    "At first, I couldn't tell the oil was sticking to the hex wrench because the body was white, so I got mad when the oil stuck to it.",
    "Assemble in 40 minutes.",
    "complete and check the product.",
    "The jump up style armrests are different in the hardness of the up and down movement, the up and down movement of the left is heavy, the right is light, and the armrest is not good to use (there is no way to adjust it).",
    "Adjusting the angle of an adjustable headrest is weak and makes a \"click\" sound and immediately falls down.",
    "The seat is made of non-recyclable high density polyurethane foam and feels hard, making it uncomfortable to sit on (is it not elastic?",
    ")The backrest part of the mesh is harder and thinner than other mesh chairs, so it hurts your back if you wear thin clothes.",
    "Small thing, the height from the seat to the ground is 530 not 550 (height matters for seat height) and the part that supports the caster is not steel so durability is questionable.",
    "I bought a new cushion and put a towel over the mesh part because it seems like it will wear out quickly.",
    "I'm 186cm 80kg and I feel like the only good thing about it is the back fit, but I feel like it's a product that's not good for anything else, and it's not a product that fits me.",
    "I think it's better to see the chair in person and sit in it before buying.",
    "I got an email from the manufacturer asking if I wanted to ask about the armrests and headrests?",
    "yeah,i'm weighing things.",
    "Well, what is it?",
    "My environment is right handed BS4K so I bought the cheaper Pixel 4K tuner without much expectation.",
    "As an experiment, free right-hand rotation broadcasts of NHK BS4K can be seen, and they can be viewed beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV that was purchased at the same time.",
    "(Sometimes the image jumps) I just bought it and it updated right away and I'm trying out some scheduled recordings, but does the external 2.5\" HDD affect it? I'm getting situations where the image just stops during playback or there's frame skipping.",
    "The user interface is not praised at all, but it is cut off as \"You can watch 4K broadcasting\".",
    "By the way, when you reserve recording, you can only rewind and play the recording of the program, and this is also a plus function that you can record 4K on HDD.",
    "You might be disappointed if you buy it expecting a lot, so don't have too high expectations.",
    "I'm expecting it to be improved in the update.",
    "the heating function is ok.",
    "I haven't used the warming function yet, but I put in two 500ml plastic bottles and it warmed up in about 2 hours and was really hot after 2.5 hours.",
    "I used it in the footwell of the passenger seat of a compact car and the fan noise is noticeable when idling but not at all when driving.",
    "It's new so there's a chemical smell coming out of the fans, I've had to open the windows regularly for ventilation.",
    "As the reviewer said, the shoulder bolt section is a bitch, so you need to use a negative driver or something to bend the bolt.",
    "they're just so, so delicate.",
    "I started using it today and it broke after two months.",
    "I like the typing feel and the size, but if it breaks, it's not worth it.",
    "I work with video all day on my PC, and the volume just randomly goes to 100%.",
    "Even if you drop it, it will be 100% again in an instant.",
    "Headphones hurt my ears and I can't use them, and at night I can't use the PC at a volume that doesn't bother others.",
    "The volume display is flickering on and off on the computer screen as if it's sending a signal every few seconds.",
    "It also interferes with mouse commands, so you have to turn off the keyboard all the time or the mouse won't work.",
    "The enter key and backspace key also don't work.",
    "I would not recommend it, but it might be worth trying for 1000 yen.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use it for half a year.",
    "Other brands have 1-3 years warranty in the same price range, but this one only has 6 months warranty.",
    "The shortness of the warranty tells a story of fragility.",
    "The product is great, but the packaging is terrible.",
    "The product is my favorite and I love the different colors.",
    "I highly recommend FoodStocker to anyone looking for a food storage solution!",
    "However, there is a huge gap between the large cardboard and it is not packaged well, no invoice and the worst packaging.",
    "The lid was also missing when I opened the box.",
    "I recommend the product, but you might want to buy it elsewhere.",
    "i'm worried about the strength, but at least",
    "I bought it because the support was unbearable and I bought it.",
    "It does its job of keeping the lid stable, but it's a fancy plastic product, so if you're not careful when opening and closing the lid, it makes a \"creaky, creaky (sounding like it's going to break)\" noise.",
    "You need to choose something that fits the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when buying.",
    "I like the meatballs.",
    "I have a dog and was looking for a backpack to take with me when I go out, I was attracted to a gray stylish backpack and I bought it.",
    "It's a build-it-yourself style, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so it didn't feel heavy at all.",
    "The buttons move smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "It looks like it'll be fun even on long trips.",
    "It folds up very compactly and it's easy to fold.",
    "Even when folded, the meatball design is visible and it's cute when placed.",
    "light and comfortable!",
    "pulleys are also used in a circular motion, so it's comfortable to use.",
    "First, I was attracted to its appearance and low price, so I bought it!",
    "I've had this TSA lock for a few years and a few others that are handy.",
    "And as a celebrity for forgetting keys and losing things, I recommend Numberlock.",
    "But honestly, I think the lightness is the most important point for me, so it's good, but if you want durability and security, the screws will be loose after a week, and the fabric will be cut with a knife! It will break in an instant.",
    "Also, the snaps are a bit loose so I would like to add some reinforcement.",
    "If you\u2019re going overseas, I recommend bringing it in your carry-on.",
    "I used it on the shinkansen and it was comfortable.",
    "It's hard to choose the size...",
    "Because of the wide range, it's hard to buy shoes.",
    "Converse and buns are 24cm.",
    "MRL996 is also 24cm.",
    "I thought it was small at first, but once you get used to it, it's fine.",
    "The ML574 this time was tough to get on because my sister said 24.5cm was too small and I had to get it for her.",
    "It felt like a finger was hitting me.",
    "So I bought a 25cm.",
    "if you open it, it's big...",
    "If you wear them, they are a bit softer even if you wear socks.",
    "I was thinking of returning it or worrying about it, but I was a little disappointed that it was 24.5, so I decided to wear it as it is 25 with an insert.",
    "Bought the team red and it\u2019s a great red!",
    "I wear a lot of monotone black and white clothes, so this brightens me up!",
    "165cm, male, 40s",
    "I ordered the L size but I've seen people recommend the M size for the same specs.",
    "Height: 165cm  Weight: 60kg  Waist: 81cm  Belly: 100cm  Typical metabolic belly.",
    "<Useful Tips>  In the water, because the hips are loose, the rush guard will be exposed.",
    "She's swimming while fixing the part that's been flipped up.",
    "Especially if you're being careless with Jaggy, you can see the metabolic belly.",
    "Also, if you walk with a lot of up and down movement, you will end up leaning forward.",
    "<Product Making> The fabric is good and not too thin, so there's no need to worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "At this price, I can be satisfied with this build, but I think the smaller one would be a better fit.",
    "i guess i leaked gas again...",
    "Silver Colt 25 was leaking gas again, I replaced the valve and it caused a problem where part of the tank was missing, [BassBondQ] used it to seal the tank and did a grisly upgrade, it shoots great now, if you want to buy one I recommend you find someone who can take it apart, I don't have the confidence to recommend it to someone who can't take it apart with a camera, if you",
    "i thought 188 yen, what kind of quality is this",
    "You can use the quick return and torque separately.",
    "I like the lightness and simplicity, without any frills.",
    "There's no glue when you attach the bit, and I thought it was a great deal for 188 yen.",
    "And then it's about durability.",
    "I don't think I'd use it often, but I think it's a good tool to have in the box.",
    "I bought it together with the same seller's \"1/4 inch square magnetic quick release driver bit holder 60/100/150 mm\"",
    "I didn't have any problems with this either, in fact I thought it was great value for money.",
    "the controller stops moving",
    "The ship will move on its own and you won't be able to control it.",
    "If you disconnect and reconnect the cable you can play again, but after a few minutes the character will move in the wrong direction and you won't be able to play.",
    "This product is not worth buying.",
    "I'm just warning you all.",
    "Cool product.",
    "It's wired, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable, and I've been using it for a long time and it still hasn't broken.",
    "You can use it for PC games too.",
    "...addendum  I was able to return the item as defective within 1 month and get a refund for the Amazon gift card, so I think that was good.",
    "So this is how the calculation power is up?",
    "I think you're a kid who understands math.",
    "It's impossible if you don't understand calculations at all, right?",
    "It's hard to solve the problem.",
    "Also, when you give your parents tools, you just have to swipe your finger up on the screen, but I tried it and it doesn't work smoothly no matter how many times you do it.",
    "Maybe it's easy to explain to someone who's familiar with DS?",
    "I can't seem to like the illustrations of manga characters, and I think it's because DS and such have a certain charm to the screen...  I don't know why I can't get attached to them.",
    "The way of calculating is also competing with time, for example, how many questions can you answer in a certain number of minutes.",
    "I understand that you have to rush through tests... but can't you at least try not to stress yourself out while calculating?",
    "The gong at the end is also satisfying.",
    "Why not make it sound more pleasant even though you're working hard?",
    "I feel like I lost money with 6,200 yen.",
    "I understand if it's half the price.",
    "sorry, this translation made it 2 instead of 1.",
    "Persona songs are good!",
    "I got to the ED in Persona 3.",
    "I played up to 5.",
    "Persona 4 is fully trophied on vita.",
    "The things you can do are the same as in the previous Persona 4.",
    "The story feels shorter than the previous one.",
    "The song is still cool!",
    "It makes me feel so good just listening to it!",
    "Persona 3 characters were HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I first saw them.",
    "Somehow, Shujin looks like an ikemen (lol) Persona 5 is already great, so it's not fresh... If you think that way, 3 seems more worth it.",
    "As a music game, I felt it was more enjoyable than 3 over 5.",
    "Persona 3 has a lot of blue, but the background was too dark to see.",
    "5 is mainly red and yellow, which are bright colors, so it is easy to see even if it overlaps with the background.",
    "I think it's good for people who are bad at rhythm games because it has a lot of assist functions.",
    "Music game veterans might find the challenge feature makes the game more teeth grinding.",
    "The triple pack has Santora but it's not just a bonus, it's a full 4 pack, so I recommend this for those who like Persona songs.",
    "i'm sorry.",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the photo, but the actual product has a blue tint and is closer to black or charcoal gray.",
    "and it wasn't a double buckle.",
    "I was thinking about buying gold too, but I'm holding off for now. The price is so low, I can't help but wonder if I should buy it.",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange it for a new one.",
    "The subsequent processing was also quick.",
    "I think they did a great job with the response, even though it was a cheap product.",
    "Added 4 stars for the response  Edited after buying gold.",
    "The color is almost the same as the photo and I think it's very nice.",
    "But still, the buckle is not double lock, and the difference is clear from the description and the photo.",
    "that's the only thing that's sad.",
    "Evenings get really heavy.",
    "I used it on a SIM-free iPhone 7s.",
    "First time setting it up, I didn't know what to do after arriving in Korea and pointing my SIM card, so I asked the lady at the SK counter at Gimpo airport (set > mobile communication > communication options > turn on data roaming), and it worked.",
    "The included manual didn't seem to matter much...?",
    "However, the area around Gimpo Airport had poor signal, so I couldn't get 3G all the time.",
    "When it came out in the city, it became 4G.",
    "Sometimes in the evening and at night, communication got really heavy, but I think I was reaching 100s of MBs a day.",
    "better than i thought",
    "I used the SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, unlocked it and used it with Ymobile, but when the Z4 started to get old, I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that can be used with new phones and bought it.",
    "I was using Mobile Suica so I was worried if it would work, but it was fine.",
    "The size, weight, and silver color make it look like an iPhone6 that I bought?",
    "No game so processing speed is the same as Z4, but it seems a bit faster  In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so I use face recognition which is faster.",
    "I thought it was great, like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase after upgrading to Android Ver9.",
    "I have a few things to say, but I'll keep it short. No strap hole *This case is for strap holes. I haven't tested the waterproofing. It's a bit heavy. I'm only using it a little bit, but I'm satisfied with it. I recommend it."
