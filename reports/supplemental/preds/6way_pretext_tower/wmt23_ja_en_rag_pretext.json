    "The Enter and Backspace keys also stopped responding.",
    "I would not recommend it at all, but if you have a thousand yen to spare, you could try buying it.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use it for half a year.",
    "Other companies offer the same price range with a warranty of 1 year to 3 years, but this one only offers a warranty of 6 months.",
    "The short warranty period speaks volumes about how fragile it is.",
    "Product is great, packaging is terrible",
    "I love the product, it's just a different color.",
    "I would like to recommend the food stocker to anyone looking for one!",
    "However, there was a lot of space between the large cardboard and the globe, and the packaging was terrible as the delivery note was not included.",

    "I would recommend the product but you might want to look elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the strength, but I'll take it",
    "I bought a replacement lid because the support was not up to scratch.",
    "It does its job in terms of stability, but it's a flimsy plastic product and if you're not careful when opening and closing the lid it makes a really annoying \"crinkle crinkle (it's about to break)\" sound.",

    "I have been using TSA locks for a few years and have a few more, they are very convenient.",
    "And as a master of forgetting and losing keys, I recommend number locks.",
    "However, I honestly put the most importance on lightness, so I would say that if you want durability and security, the snaps are a bit of a let down, they snap pretty hard and the fabric is pretty thin, so if you cut it with a knife it will break in a second.",
    "Also, the snaps are a bit soft so I would like to see some overlapping to make it more durable.",
    "For overseas, I recommend carrying it on.",

    "When I put them on, they were a little loose even with socks on.",
    "I was wondering if I should return it, but since it's a hassle to return it, I'm going to wear it with the 25cm inserts.",
    "I bought the team red and it's a great bright red!",
    "Since there are many monochrome outfits in black and white, wearing this will make you look brighter!",
    "165cm, 40s male",

    "<Product construction> The fabric is durable and not too thin, so there is no concern about the nipples showing through.",
    "At this price and with this design, I'm satisfied, but I think the smaller size would be better fitting.",

    "Silver Colt 25 is still leaking gas, I replaced the barrel and there was a problem with the tank, but I fixed it by using the [HobbyQ] and sealing the tank, then I could shoot it with confidence, but I don't recommend this to anyone who can't disassemble it, I took pictures of the disassembled parts, but I don't recommend this to anyone who doesn't have confidence in disass",
    "I thought it was 188 yen, what quality do you think it is?",
    "You can use the early release and torque when needed.",
    "Light, small, and simple, which is good.",
    "There is no gate when you attach the bit, and I thought this was a surprisingly good cospa for 188 yen.",
    "How durable it is, I guess.",
    "I don't know how often you'll use it, but I think it's a good thing to have in your toolbox.",
    "I bought this along with the 1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release driver bit holder 60/100/150mm from the same seller.",
    "This one is also problem free, or rather, it's pretty good for the price.",
    "The controller stopped working.",
    "The controller will start moving the player around on its own.",
    "If I reconnect the cable it works but after a few minutes it moves the joystick in the wrong direction and I can't operate it.",
    "Don't buy this product.",
    "I'll warn you all.",
    "It's a terrible product.",
    "It's wired, but I recommend the controller for the BEBONCOOL PS3.",

    "You can also use it for PC games.",

    "I wonder if it's easier for people who are used to the DS?",
    "I can't get into the art of the characters in the manga, either, or I think DS and stuff, you get into it from the fun of the screen, but... I can't get into it.",
    "It's also a time-based method, where you have to answer a certain number of questions in a certain amount of time.",
    "I understand the urge to rush with tests...do you get anxious and calculate?",
    "I don't like it when the gong rings at the end, either.",
    "Shouldn't it be more pleasant to hear the sound when you're working hard?",
    "I feel like I'm losing money with this 6200 yen.",

    "As a game, I found 5 easier to play than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is mostly blue, so it's hard to see the backgrounds.",
    "5 has bright colors like red and yellow as the main colors, so they are easy to see even if they are covered by the background.",
    "With the abundance of assist features, I think even those who are not good at games can enjoy it.",
    "For those who are used to playing games, the challenge feature will make it a more challenging game.",

    "And it wasn't a double buckle.",

    "Update: I received an email from the seller offering to exchange the new product for the old one.",
    "The follow up was also quick.",
    "I think the response was very good despite the cheap product.",
    "4 stars for the response.  Follow up: I also purchased gold.",
    "I think the color is almost exactly like the picture and it's very pretty.",

    "It gets heavy in the evening.",
    "I used the SIM free iPhone 7s.",
    "At first setup, I didn't know what to do after I got to Korea and pointed my SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo airport (just turn data roaming on from settings > mobile communication > communication options) and it worked out fine.",

    "The thing is, I've been having a hard time getting 3G in the Gimpo airport area, which is notorious for bad reception.",
    "When I went out into the city, it switched to 4G.",

    "Size, weight, and the fact that I bought it silver gives me the impression that it's an iPhone6?",
    "I don't play games so I don't know about the processing speed, but it seems a bit faster than the Z4.  I read a review that said the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a while to recognize it, so I use the face recognition.",
    "I thought it was like an iPhone and it was amazing, but I also got an Android with Ver9 and I was satisfied with my purchase.",
