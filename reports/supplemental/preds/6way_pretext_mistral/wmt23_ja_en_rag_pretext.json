    "It's an original product from a security camera manufacturer I used to use.",
    "The effect is better with the manufacturer's product than with the one sold at the home center.",

    "I don't like the gong that sounds when it's over.",
    "Why not make it a more pleasant sounding one, even though you're working hard?",
    "This makes me feel like I lost 6200 yen.",
    "I can understand this half price.",
    "Sorry, I translated it like this \u26062.",
    "I really like Persona songs!",
    "I've reached the ED on Persona 3.",
    "I played until the middle of 5.",
    "Persona 4 is already out on Vita.",
    "It's not much different from Persona 4.",
    "It feels shorter than the previous one, as if it doesn't have a story.",
    "The music is really catchy!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "The characters in Persona 3 were the first to be HD, so I was moved when I first saw them.",
    "Somehow, Junpei looks like a handsome man (laugh). Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so there is no freshness... I feel that 3 is more worth it when I think so.",
    "As a soundtrack, I felt that 5 was easier to listen to than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is blue as the main color, but the background is dark so it's hard to see.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it's against a background.",
    "With all the assist functions, I think even people who are bad at music will be able to play.",
    "For those who are good at rhythm games, it might be a game that makes you grind your teeth when you turn on the challenge function.",
    "The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just a bonus like in the past, it's a full 4-disc set, so I'd recommend it to anyone who loves Persona's music.",
    "It's a shame.",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the picture, but the actual product has a blue tint and is closer to charcoal gray than black.",
    "And it wasn't double-breasted.",
    "That's why I was thinking of buying gold, but I'm holding off for now. Is the price too low to give up?",
    "Addendum: I received an email from the seller after the review was posted, apologizing and offering to exchange the product for a new one.",
    "The subsequent handling was also done quickly.",
    "I think the response was excellent, regardless of the price of the product.",
    "I give them 4 stars for the response. I also bought the gold.",
    "The colour is almost exactly as in the photo and is very nice.",
    "But the buckle is not double-locked as shown in the description photo.",
    "That's the only downside.",
    "It gets a little heavy in the evening.",
    "I used it on a SIM-free iPhone 7s.",
    "At first, I didn't know how to do it when I arrived in Korea and pointed to my SIM card, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Incheon International Airport and she taught me (Settings > Mobile Communications > Communication Options, turn on Data Roaming).",
    "The instructions that came with the product didn't seem to be very relevant...?",
    "However, around Incheon Airport, the signal was poor, and I couldn't get 3G for a long time.",
    "It turned into 4G when I went to the city.",
    "Sometimes the communication became heavy in the evening or at night, and I think it might have reached a maximum of several hundred MB per day.",
    "Better than I thought.",
    "I used SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim free and used it with Ymobile, because Z4 was not good, I was looking for a used Xperia, but I bought this phone because it can be used with a new SIM card.",
    "I was worried that it wouldn't work properly since I was using Mobile Suica, but there were no problems at all.",
    "The size, weight, and silver color make it look like an iPhone 6 to me.",
    "No game, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, but it feels a little faster.  The review said the fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so I use face recognition instead.",
    "I thought it was amazing, just like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase, even though I had upgraded to Android version 9.",
    "What I noticed  A little smaller would be nice, no strap hole, *works with cases that have strap holes, not tested for water resistance, a little heavy, I haven't used it much but I'm satisfied, I recommend it."
