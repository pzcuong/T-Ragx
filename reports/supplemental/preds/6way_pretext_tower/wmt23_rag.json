    "I thought I would use it for fixing electronics or making gunpla, but it's a pain that there's no B4 size.",
    "If you only use it for half-tone work, and use another tray or mat for assembly and disassembly, maybe it will work.",
    "It's not practical to have tools, parts, and work in the area of the magazine size.",
    "I thought about ordering another one and doubling the size, but the work is so electrically charged and the dust and cut pieces stick to everything so I'm not sure I can keep using it for long.",
    "a fatal flaw.",
    "I finally got the battery box open by using a rubber gasket to pry the lid off, but when I tried to close it with the battery in it, it wouldn't close.",
    "You are out at this point.",
    "The one with the high rating!",
    "Does the battery box lid close?",
    "If you add it, it comes with a small saran wrap instead of the product's protective seal.",
    "Is this a second hand item?",
    "The only explanation is a small piece of paper with a lot of written in English.",
    "I don't understand the diagrams or how to operate them.",
    "I wonder if it would be better to use another finger\u2026",
    "I found a good product!",
    "I immediately bought it.",
    "I use the pinky ring so I don't have to wear a lot of rings and it's a little rough around the edges and a little bit...",
    "But I think it's good for the other fingers.",
    "But I think he's a good idea merchant.",
    "it's a good price",
    "You shouldn't expect quality from products like this.",
    "The flower mark was crushed.",
    "I think the size is just right.",
    "People with thick skin may be tough.",
    "Maybe you should have bought a plain one.",
    "it's a bit much",
    "The design is good but it's big and bulky, will it still work if I attach it to my feet?",
    "It's winter in the Tohoku region, so...",
    "As mentioned in other reviews, the electric heating wire is only 110x80 and the placement is not vertical but horizontal.",
    "I bought one that is more expensive than the ones that are just for sleeping, but I have never been disappointed with it. However, I can't check it out in the store like I can with the famous brands, so I'm not sure.",
    "You can only use it with hot water bottles and the N-warmth of the Toris.",
    "By the way, the quality of the blanket is irrelevant.",
    "it's good, but",
    "Small and has enough airflow.",
    "Battery can be replaced with a spare.",
    "If you put it on a tripod and adjust the angle, it looks like a photo.",
    "If it lands on your desk it will fly off at its own speed but you can lay a handkerchief over it and it won't be a problem.",
    "The sound, if you use it outside/in a family restaurant, you won\u2019t notice it even if you set it to \u201cmedium\u201d, but if you use it in an office, you can\u2019t use it even if you set it to \u201clow\u201d because it\u2019s too loud.",
    "It is necessary to have a clear understanding that they are only there to help you when you go out.",
    "Also, for office use, even the \"small\" ones are too cold and have too much airflow.",
    "Running out the back sweating and hiding in a fast food joint and saying \u201cI\u2019m cool\u201d is perfect for this scene.",
    "One thing, when you throw it in your bag, sometimes the power button gets pressed and it goes into a loop without you knowing.",
    "You can try to push the button a little bit (depress it) or make them hold the button down for a few seconds.",
    "It's a necessary item in a time of extreme heat that can be life threatening, so it's good to have a better one.",
    "Multi-functional light speaker",
    "I have it in the weakest warm color and I use it in my bedroom.",
    "It's better than I thought!",
    "I'm glad I bought it.",
    "As a light, it can be adjusted with touch controls for brightness and color.",
    "White color goes with any room and color light changes in gradation so it looks pretty.",
    "You can also touch the place you like and it will stop at your favorite color, so you can light it up according to your mood!",
    "LEDs are expected to last longer.",
    "In terms of sound quality, I think it's a pretty satisfying level for my untrained ears.",

    "It can be paired with your phone via Bluetooth, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.",
    "\u30fbYou can also make hands-free calls if you pair your mobile phone.",

    "Piano practice and drilling",
    "I started DTM at 66 to prevent bokeh.",
    "I bought the audio interface and the main unit.",

    "I think it was a good buy.",
    "I feel like I'm being fooled by appearances.",
    "Are there any items that are out of stock?",
    "it's a long post.",
    "I bought a synthetic leather office chair (reclining armrest) made by Doshisha 4-5 years ago and the synthetic leather has deteriorated and become threadbare, so I am considering buying a reclining armrest chair made of non-synthetic leather.",
    "I've been looking at home centers and furniture stores but I can't find anything suitable.",
    "I was hesitant because I couldn\u2019t see the product but I compromised on the design and price and bought it on Amazon.",
    "The box is surprisingly light and compact.",
    "I have a spare piece of thread.",
    "[Attention] The hex wrench and screws that come with it are oily.",
    "At first, I was confused about the oil on the hex wrench, because the body was white and I was worried when the oil was on it.",
    "It takes 40 minutes to assemble.",
    "Finished and confirmed the product.",
    "The armrests are different in terms of how hard they are to raise and lower, and the left armrest is heavier and the right armrest is lighter, which makes the armrests less comfortable to use (there is no way to adjust them).",
    "The angle adjustment of the movable headrest drops immediately with a weak fixation force and a \u201cclunk\u201d sound.",
    "The seat feels hard and uncomfortable (does it lack elasticity?",
    ")The competition mesh on the backrest is stiffer and thinner than other mesh chairs, which can be painful if you sit on it too thin.",
    "Just to be picky, the height from the seat to the ground is 530 not 550 (height from the seat to the ground is important for tall people) and the castor support legs are not steel so durability is questionable.",
    "I bought a new cushion and put a towel on the mesh part because it seems to wear out quickly.",
    "I felt the back fit was good for me at 186cm 80kg but the rest of the product was not satisfactory, felt like a miss-sized product.",
    "I guess it's better to see the office chairs in person and buy them.",
    "I got a welcome email from the manufacturer saying I could ask for armrests and headrests, so I did.",
    "we're looking into it.",
    "I mean, what is this?",
    "I bought a Pixel 4K tuner for a reasonable price without much hope since the environment of the house is right-handed and it seems that the right-handed BS4K is visible.",
    "As an experiment, free broadcasting of right-handed spinning, starting with NHK BS4K, is seen, and at the same time, it can be enjoyed beautifully on the purchased Panasonic 4K TV.",
    "(Sometimes the image jumps) After purchasing, the update came right away and it is compatible with recording, so I have made a few reservations to watch, but I think the external HDD affects it, because when I play it, the image stops, or the frame skips, or something like that.",
    "The user interface is not praised either, and they are content with \"4K broadcasting can be seen\".",
    "By the way, I have the impression that while recording, you can only rewind the recorded program, and I also accept this as a plus feature that allows you to record 4K on the HDD.",
    "You might be disappointed if you buy it with high expectations, so don't overdo it.",
    "We expect to see improvements with the update.",
    "The heating function is OK",
    "It only has the heating function, but I put 2 500ml pet bottles in it and it warmed up in about 2 hours and got hot in 2.5 hours.",
    "I have used it in the passenger footwell of a compact car, but I only notice the fan noise when idling, not while driving.",
    "It's new so it's emitting some kind of chemical smell that's bothering me, I had to open the window regularly to get some fresh air.",
    "As written in the review, the range of the shoulder strap is terrible, so you need to make sure to fold the range with negative drivers.",
    "they're just so, so delicate.",
    "I started using it today and it broke after 2 months.",
    "I liked the feel of the keys and the size, but it's not worth it if it breaks.",
    "I work with video editing all day and my PC randomly goes to 100% volume.",
    "It will go down but it will come back to 100% in a second.",
    "I can't use headphones because it hurts my ears and I can't use my PC at night because the volume is too low.",
    "It seems to send out signals every few seconds and the volume display will come and go on the computer screen.",
    "Also, the mouse's instructions are often hindered by the keyboard, so you can't use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard.",
    "The enter and backspace keys also stopped working.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it at all, but if you're willing to spend a thousand yen, you could try it.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use it for half a year.",
    "Other brands have a warranty of 1-3 years for the same price range, but this one only has a 6 month warranty.",
    "The short warranty speaks to the fragility.",
    "Products are great, packaging is terrible",
    "I have a different color and I love it.",
    "I would highly recommend the food stocker to anyone looking for one!",
    "However, there was a lot of space between the boxes and they were packed very poorly with no packing list.",
    "The box was open when I opened the lid.",
    "I would recommend the product but you might be better off buying it elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the strength, but for now",
    "I bought it because the stand was not good enough when I replaced the cover.",
    "It does its job in terms of lid stability, but it's a flimsy plastic product and if you're not careful with opening and closing the lid it makes a really annoying \"crinkle crinkle (breaky)\" sound.",
    "You need to be careful when purchasing as you can't choose the thickness of the lid.",
    "I like the cute back of the meatball",
    "I was looking for a backpack to take my dog out and I was attracted to this grey backpack and I bought it.",
    "It's a kit and surprisingly light when you hold it so it's not too heavy to carry around.",
    "The zipper also moves smoothly and there are no snags.",
    "I think it would be fun to travel for a long time.",
    "It's very compact and easy to fold.",
    "It can be folded and the design of the meatballs is visible, so it's cute even when it's not in use.",
    "Light and comfortable!",
    "The pulleys are also easy to use.",
    "First, I was immediately attracted to the appearance and low price, so I bought it!",
    "I\u2019ve had a TSA lock for a few years and have a few others but this one is convenient.",
    "And as a master of forgetting and losing keys, I recommend numberlock.",
    "However, I do put the most emphasis on lightness, which is honestly the only downside, but if you want durability and security, the seam is loud and the fabric is thin, so if you get cut with a knife, it will tear in an instant.",
    "Also, the seam of the zipper is sweet so I need to work on overlapping",
    "For overseas, we recommend carrying it on the plane.",
    "I used it for shinkansen travel so far and it was comfortable.",
    "It's hard to choose the size...",
    "I have a wide foot and it's hard to find shoes that fit.",
    "Converse and Bans are wearing 24cm",
    "MRL996 is 24cm too.",
    "I thought it was going to be hard at first but I got used to it.",
    "This ML574 was a bit too tight for my sister, who said it was too tight at 24.5cm.",
    "I felt like my pinky finger was hitting something.",
    "I bought a 25cm one.",
    "I opened it and it was huge.",
    "I tried it on and it's a little looser with socks on.",
    "I was thinking about returning it but I don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of returning it so I\u2019m just going to wear them with the 25 inch inserts.",
    "I purchased team red but the bright red is so good!",
    "Since they wear mostly monochrome outfits in black and white, wearing these will make you look brighter!",
    "165cm, 40s male",
    "I ordered a L size but they recommended an M size because it looks like the following specs.",
    "Height: 165 cm  Weight: 60 kg  Waist: 81 cm  Belly: 100 cm  Typical metabolic belly.",
    "<Used Gogochi> In the water, the hip part is loose, so the rush guard is raised.",
    "she's swimming up, fixing the part that came off.",
    "Especially if you let yourself go in jaggies, you can see the metabo belly.",
    "Also, if you walk while you are vigorously moving up and down, you will end up getting stuck in the middle.",
    "<Product creation>  The fabric is durable and not too thin, so there's no need to worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "For this price, you can be satisfied with this build, but I think it will fit better if you buy the smaller one.",
    "I guess it was a gas leak...",
    "Silver Colt 25 has a gas leak, also when you replace the valve, you have to replace the tank, but if you use [Bass Bond Q] to seal the tank and repair grease, it becomes easy to shoot, if you want to buy this Colt 25, you can ask the person who can disassemble it or take pictures while disassembling, but I don't recommend it to people who don't have confidence,",
    "I thought it was 188 yen, but I thought it was a good quality",
    "You can use the early crank and torque when you need it.",
    "I like the lightness, smallness, and simplicity of it.",
    "There is no difference in quality when you attach the bits, and I thought this was a surprisingly cheap price for 188 yen.",
    "The rest is durability.",
    "I don't use it that often but I think it's a good thing to have in your toolbox.",
    "I bought this along with the same seller's \"1/4 inch hex magnetic quick release driver release lever bit holder 60/100/150 mm\"",
    "This one is also fine, it was pretty good for the price.",
    "controller stops working.",
    "The player's character will move on its own and you will not be able to control it.",
    "You can operate it by reconnecting the cable, but after a few minutes, the player will move in the wrong direction and you can't operate it.",
    "You should not buy this product.",
    "I'll give you a warning.",
    "It's a terrible product.",
    "It's wired, but I would recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable and still going strong after years of use.",
    "It can also be used in PC games.",
    "\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb Update: I think it was a good thing that they could return the Amazon gift card as a return for a defective item within a month.",
    "Does this make your calculation power go up?",
    "I think it's good for kids who understand math.",
    "I don't think it's impossible if you don't understand the calculations?",
    "It's a difficult problem.",
    "Also, when it comes to giving the parent the tools, I\u2019ve tried doing it myself but it never goes smoothly no matter how many times I do it.",
    "I guess it\u2019s easier to fool someone who\u2019s used to DS.?",
    "I can't really get into the character illustrations in manga, and I think DS and such are fun to play because of the screen, but for some reason I can't get into them.",
    "The way it works is like a time trial, where you have to answer a certain number of questions in a certain amount of time.",
    "I understand that you are in a hurry because of the exam, but do you not get anxious and start calculating?",
    "I don't like the fact that it ends with a gong.",
    "I\u2019m working hard, but shouldn\u2019t I be making it sound more pleasant?",
    "I feel like I'm losing money with 6,200 yen.",
    "I understand that this is half the price.",
    "Sorry, it's translated as 2\u2606",
    "I still like Persona songs!",
    "Persona 3 gets to the ED.",

    "Without a story, it feels shorter than the previous one.",
    "The music is really good!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "Persona 3 characters were the first to be HD, so I was moved when I first saw them.",
    "I guess Seonhwa looks like a hunk (laugh) Persona 5 is beautiful from the start, so there's no freshness... I think it's cheaper to think that the third one is better.",
    "As a music game, I found 5 to be more fun than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is mostly blue, but it was hard to see in the dark background.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it's covered by the background.",
    "I think it's a game that even people who don't like rhythm games can enjoy because of the assist features.",
    "I think the challenge feature makes it a more challenging game for those who are experienced with rhythm games.",
    "The triple pack comes with Santora, which is not just a gimmick but a solid 4-pack, so if you like Persona music, I recommend this.",
    "i'm sorry.",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face on the photo but the actual one is a bit blue but it's close to black or charcoal gray.",
    "And it wasn't a double buckle.",
    "I was thinking about buying gold but I\u2019m holding off for now, should I just give up on it because it\u2019s cheap?",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to replace the item with a new one after the review was posted.",
    "The rest of the processing was quick.",
    "I think the service is great even for cheap items.",
    "Response: 4 stars  Follow up: I also bought gold.",
    "The color is pretty much the same as the photo and it looks really nice.",
    "But the difference between the double locking buckle and the one in the picture is clear.",
    "That's the only thing that's a shame.",
    "Evening gets really heavy.",
    "I used the SIM free iPhone 7s.",
    "At first, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing my SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport (go to settings > mobile communication > communication options and turn data roaming ON) and she helped me out.",
    "The instructions that came with the product didn't seem to matter much...?",
    "However, the Gimpo airport area has poor reception, so I had to hold onto 3G for a long time.",
    "It became 4G when it was released.",
    "I had some really heavy downloads in the evening and at night, but looking back I probably hit the daily limit of a few hundred MB.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I had been using a Softbank Z4 for 2 years, and had it unlocked and was using it on Ymobile, but when the Z4 started to give me trouble I was looking for a used Xperia to buy, but then I found this phone and bought it, which is a new phone that can be used as a prepaid phone.",
    "I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use it because I was using a mobile Suica, but it worked fine.",
    "Size, weight, silver, and I think I bought it because it looked like an iPhone 6.",
    "Since I don\u2019t use GAME, the processing speed is the same as Z4, and I have the impression that it\u2019s a bit faster.  In the review, it was said that the fingerprint recognition was slow, but I have the impression that it takes a bit of time to recognize it, so I use the face recognition.",
    "I thought it was like an iPhone and it was awesome. I also upgraded my Android to Ver9 and I was satisfied with my purchase.",
