    "I think I made a good purchase.",
    "I feel like I was deceived by its appearance.",
    "Is it a product that is not as good as it looks?",
    "usually these questions take the form of a superlong paragraph",
    "I've been using a Doshisha made office chair (jump up armrest) for 4~5 years, but the synthetic leather has deteriorated and is now dull, so I'm considering purchasing a non-synthetic leather jump up armrest chair.",
    "I searched home centers and furniture stores, but I couldn't find anything suitable.",
    "I was worried that I wouldn't be able to confirm the actual product, but I compromised on the design and price and purchased this product on Amazon.",
    "The box of the product was surprisingly light and compact.",
    "There is one spare neck.",
    "\u3010Notice\u3011The hexagonal wrench and nut that come with it are rusty from oil.",
    "First, I was worried because the oil was still attached to the hexagonal wrench and the main body was white.",
    "It took 40 minutes to assemble.",
    "Completed and confirmed the product.",
    "The hardness of the jump up armrests is different on the left and right, and it is heavier to lift up on the left and lighter on the right, so the armrests are not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).",
    "The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and the fixed force is weak, so it falls down quickly with a \"kachii\" sound.",
    "The seat feels hard and uncomfortable (is the springiness weak?",
    ") The backrest part of the competition mesh is harder and thinner than other mesh chairs, so it hurts your back.",
    "The height from the seat to the ground was 550, but it was 530 (the height of the seat is important for tall people). Also, the part of the legs that are supported by casters is not made of steel, so there are doubts about durability.",
    "I bought a separate cushion to put on it, and I use a towel to cover the mesh fabric part because it seems like it will deteriorate (wear and tear) quickly.",
    "I felt that it was a good fit for my back, but other than that, I felt that it was a low satisfaction product, and I felt that it was a product that was not worth the price.",
    "I think it would be better to see the actual chair and try it out before buying it.",
    "I received a message from the manufacturer about the purchase, so should I ask about the armrest and headrest?",
    "yeah,i'm weighing things.",
    "Well, it's something like this.",
    "I bought a Pixelsa 4K tuner at a low price because it seems that I can see the right turn of the BS4K in my house.",
    "As an experiment, I can watch the right-turning free broadcast starting with NHK BS4K, and at the same time, I can enjoy it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV that I bought.",
    "(The picture sometimes flickers) An update came soon after purchase, and I've been watching a few scheduled recordings, but I think it's because of the external drive that's a 2.5-inch HDD, but the picture stops and frame skips happen during playback.",
    "The user interface is also not something to be praised, and it simply says \"you can watch 4K broadcasts\".",
    "By the way, in the case of scheduled recording, it seems that only the playback of the scheduled recording can be done, so I accept this as a plus function that can record in 4K to the HDD.",
    "I think that people who expect a lot and buy it will be disappointed, so it's better not to expect too much.",
    "I expect it to be improved by the update.",
    "The heating function is OK",
    "I haven't used the warming function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it warmed up in about 2 hours and was hot after about 2.5 hours.",
    "I used it in the footwell of the passenger seat of a compact car. The fan noise is noticeable when the car is idle, but I don't feel it at all when the car is in motion.",
    "It's still new, so there's a smell like a chemical substance being blown out, so I had to regularly open the window for ventilation.",
    "As written in the review, the part where the short wire is connected is very bad, so you need to bend the bar so that it can be bent by a negative driver or the like.",
    "they're just so, so delicate.",
    "I started using it today, and it broke suddenly after 2 months.",
    "I liked the feel and size of the keys, but it's no good if it breaks.",
    "I work on video editing all day on my PC, but the volume automatically goes to 100%.",
    "Even if I lower it, it instantly goes back to 100%.",
    "I can't use the earphones because they hurt my ears, and the volume is too loud for me to use the PC at night.",
    "It sends a signal every few seconds, so the volume display appears and disappears on the computer screen.",
    "Also, the mouse is interfered by the keyboard, so I can't use the mouse freely unless I turn off the keyboard.",
    "The enter key and backspace key also stopped working.",
    "I don't recommend it at all, but if it's a thousand yen or so, you might as well try it.",
    "If you're lucky, you can use it for about half a year.",
    "Other brands are also in the same price range, but they offer 1 year to 3 years of warranty, while this one only offers 6 months.",
    "The short warranty period suggests that it is easy to break.",
    "The product is great, but the packaging is terrible",
    "I use the product in a different colour and it's my favourite.",
    "I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a footstool!!",
    "Just, there were gaps so big that you could fall through them like a cardboard box, and there was no delivery slip and the packaging was terrible.",
    "The lid was also missing when I opened the box.",
    "I recommend the product, but maybe it's better to buy it elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the strength, but",
    "I bought it because I was worried about the support when I bought the cover.",
    "It does its job in terms of stability, but as it's a fancy plastic product, it makes a nasty sound like 'mekeke (it's going to break)' when you open and close the lid.",
    "You have to choose something that matches the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when you buy it.",
    "I love the cute paw print on the bag",
    "I was looking for a backpack to take my dog out, and I was attracted to this stylish gray backpack, so I bought it here.",
    "It was assembled in a kit form, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so I felt that it wasn't that heavy.",
    "The fastener also moves smoothly and there are no catches.",
    "It's comfortable even for long trips.",
    "It folds up very compactly and is easy to fold.",
    "Even when folded up, it looks like a cute ball, and it's cute when placed.",
    "It's light and comfortable!",
    "The pulleys are also easy to use",
    "First, I fell in love with the appearance and the low price, so I immediately bought it!",
    "I've had the TSA lock for a few years now and it's been my favorite, but I also have a few others that are handy too.",
    "And as a key forgetting and losing celebrity, I recommend the Namba Lock.",
    "I'm just being honest, but I put the most important point on the lightness, so it's good, but if you want reliability and security, the fastener is a week, it's made of cloth, and it can be cut with a knife in an instant, so it will break immediately.",
    "Also, I want to have a combination of the Fassner's that is cheap and overlaps.",
    "If you're going overseas, I recommend bringing it on the plane.",
    "I used it on the bullet train and it was comfortable.",
    "It's difficult to choose the size...",
    "I have a hard time buying shoes because of the wide range of sizes.",
    "I wear 24cm Converse and Vans.",
    "MRL996\u308224cm\u3002",
    "I thought it was uncomfortable at first, but I got used to it.",
    "This time, I tried the ML574 with my sister's 24.5cm, and it was really tight. I was able to wear it, but it was really tight.",
    "It felt like my little finger was touching.",
    "So I bought 25cm.",
    "I opened it and it was too big...",
    "I tried them on and even with socks they were a bit loose.",
    "I was worried about returning it, but if I get a 24.5 and it's still too tight, it'll be a hassle, so I think I'll put in an insole and wear it as is.",
    "I bought a team ledge and it's really good with fresh reds!",
    "I have a lot of black and white monochrome clothes, so when I wear these, it brightens up!",
    "165cm, 40s male",
    "I ordered the L size as a rough estimate, but I recommend the M size for those who are similar to the following specs.",
    "Height: 165cm Weight: 60kg Waist: 81cm Abdomen: 100cm Typical belly.",
    "(The waist is loose) When I wear it underwater, the rush guard is pushed up.",
    "I'm swimming while fixing the part that's pulled up.",
    "Especially when I'm careless in the jacuzzi, my belly becomes round.",
    "Also, when I walk while doing a lot of up and down movements, it still gets pushed up from the bottom.",
    "<Construction of the product> The material is sturdy and not too thin, so there is no need to worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "I think that if you buy a smaller size at this price, you'll be satisfied.",
    "I guess it really did leak gas...",
    "The Silver Cort25 did have a gas leak, and when I was exchanging the valve, there was a problem where part of the tank was missing, but if you use the [Vent Q] to seal the tank and then do a repair upgrade, it will be able to be used normally. If you want to buy this Cort25, I would recommend that you ask someone who can disassemble and reassemble it, or if you can't do it yourself, I wouldn't",
    "I thought it would be of a certain quality for 188 yen",
    "You can use the quick return and torque when you need to.",
    "Light and small, but most importantly, it's nice to have a simple design without any frills.",
    "There is no gap when attaching the bit, and I thought it was a great bargain at 188 yen.",
    "The durability is the only thing I'm worried about.",
    "I don't think I'll use it that much, but I think it's a good thing to have in a toolbox.",
    "I bought it together with the \"1/4 inch hexagonal wrench magnetic quick release driver ratchet bit holder 60/100/150 mm\" from the same seller.",
    "I had no problems with this, in fact, it was a great value for the price.",
    "the controller stops moving",
    "Sometimes the machine moves on its own and can't be operated.",
    "If you reconnect the cable, you can operate it, but after a few minutes, it will suddenly move in an abnormal direction and you won't be able to operate it.",
    "I don't recommend buying this product.",
    "I would like to warn everyone in advance.",
    "It's a great product.",
    "It's wireless, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable and I've been using it for a long time and it hasn't broken yet.",
    "It can also be used for PC games.",
    "\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb Afternote: I returned it as a defective product within one month, and I got a refund of Amazon gift certificate, so I think it was good in that sense.",
    "Will this improve my calculation skills?",
    "I think you understand the calculation.",
    "I think it's possible if you can understand some calculations to some extent.",
    "I can't solve the problem.",
    "Also, when I give my parents tools, I point to the screen and ask them to put it up, but I tried it myself and it doesn't go smoothly no matter how many times I try.",
    "In other words, it may be easier to let someone who is familiar with DS do it.",
    "I can't get into the illustrations of manga characters, or maybe it's because I'm more interested in the screen itself, like DS, but for some reason I can't get into it.",
    "The way of calculating is also a method that competes with time, such as how many questions can be answered in how many minutes.",
    "I understand the feeling of wanting to hurry up for an exam, but... wouldn't it be better to not make them feel anxious and just have them calculate?",
    "When it's over, I don't like the sound of the gong.",
    "I'm working hard, but can't you make the sound more pleasant?",
    "I feel like I've lost money with this, 6200 yen.",
    "I understand the price of this half.",
    "I'm sorry, I misunderstood this as 2 pieces.",
    "I really like the songs by Persona!",
    "I got to the ED of Persona 3.",
    "I played up to 5.",
    "Persona 4 is completed on the Vita.",
    "What you can do is the same as in the previous Persona 4.",
    "Because the story is non-existent, it feels shorter than the previous game.",
    "The songs are really cool!",
    "Listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "Persona 3's characters were the first to be HD-ized, so I was moved when I first saw them.",
    "I thought Naotora looked like a handsome man (laughs) Persona 5 is already beautiful, so it's not fresh anymore... I think that way, and it feels like 3 is worth it.",
    "As a sound gear, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was hard to see against a dark background.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it's overlaid on the background.",
    "It has a lot of assist functions, so I think even people who are bad at audio games can play it.",
    "Sound game experts can make it a challenging game by turning on the challenge function.",
    "Triple Pack has a Santolla attached, but it's not just a bonus, it's a solid 4-piece set, so I recommend it to those who like the Persona songs.",
    "what?!",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the photo, but the actual product is a dark blue or charcoal gray.",
    "and it wasn't double-backed.",
    "I was also thinking of buying gold, but I'm still thinking about it. I might give up because the price is low.",
    "Postscript: After posting the review, I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange it for a new one.",
    "The subsequent processing was also quick.",
    "I think the response was very good even for a cheap item.",
    "4 stars for the service.  Update: I also bought the gold version.",
    "The color is almost exactly the same as the photo, and I think it's very beautiful.",
    "But the buckle is not double lock as shown in the description photo.",
    "That's the only thing that's disappointing.",
    "evening is going to be really heavy.",
    "I used it on my SIM-free iPhone7s.",
    "At first, I didn't know how to set it up after arriving in Korea and pointing the SIM card to SK counter lady at Gimpo airport (set up > mobile communication > communication options > turn on data roaming) and it worked well.",
    "The instructions that came with the product were not very helpful...?",
    "However, the reception in the area around Gimpo Airport is poor, so I kept 3G on.",
    "When I went out into the city, it switched to 4G.",
    "In the evening and at night, the communication sometimes became very heavy, but now I think that it may have reached the maximum limit of 100MB per day.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I used Softbank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim-free Ymobile, and when Z4 started to malfunction, I was looking for a used Xperia when I found this new phone that I could use with my old SIM card.",
    "I was worried that it wouldn't work properly because I was using a mobile Suica card, but there were no problems at all.",
    "It's a bit big, heavy, and silver, so it looks like an iPhone 6?",
    "It doesn't play games so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, but it feels a little faster. According to the review, the fingerprint recognition is slow, so it takes a little time to recognize it. That's why I use the face recognition.",
    "I thought it was like an iPhone, it's so cool! I also switched to Android 9, and I was able to buy a phone that I was satisfied with.",
    "I'm a little concerned about it. It would be better if it were a little smaller. There's no strap hole. *It's compatible with cases with strap holes. I haven't tested its water resistance. It's a little heavy. I haven't used it much yet, but I'm satisfied. I recommend it."
