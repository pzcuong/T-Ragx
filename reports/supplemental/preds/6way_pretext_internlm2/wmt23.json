    "in the winter, it's cold in the east",
    "As with other reviews, the heating wire is only 110\u00d780 and is placed horizontally, not vertically.",
    "I bought this because it's bigger than the ones I usually buy, and it's more expensive than the ones I usually buy because it's a whole blanket, but I can't check it out at the store like a famous maker, so I guess I have no choice.",

    "Also, as an office worker, even if it's small, the air volume is too much and it gets too cold.",
    "It's the perfect scene to sweat profusely at the venue and then run to the family restaurant to cool down with a \"big\" meal.",
    "Just one thing, sometimes when you put it in your bag, it will turn off by itself if you don't know that you pressed the power button.",
    "It's good to have tricks like pulling the button slightly (making it fall) or making the first press weak and the second press strong.",

    "It's an LED so it's expected to have a long life span.",
    "As for the sound quality, I think it's a level that is more than enough to satisfy my amateur ears.",
    "Another great thing about this light is that it's so versatile.",
    "- There is a large speaker on the top.",
    "You can enjoy music wirelessly because you can pair it with a mobile phone or Bluetooth.",

    "I have completed the order and confirmed the product.",

    "The adjustable headrest angle is weakly fixed and drops down immediately with a \"kachii\" sound.",
    "The seats feel hard and uncomfortable to sit on (is the cushioning weak?",
    ") The mesh backrest for the competition is harder and thinner than the mesh chairs of other companies, so it hurts your back if you sit on it for a long time.",
    "The height from the seat to the ground was not 550 but 530 (the height of the seat is important for tall people). Also, the part that supports the caster is not made of steel, so there is a question about durability.",
    "I put a cushion on top of it, and use a towel to cover the mesh part because it seems to deteriorate (get damaged) quickly.",
    "I feel that the only thing that is good about the 186cm 80kg me is the fit of the back, but I feel that the other parts are not satisfactory and that there are some products that are not suitable for me.",
    "I think it's better to sit and buy it in person.",

    "As an experiment, I can see the free broadcast of NHK BS4K, and at the same time, I can enjoy it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV that I bought.",
    "(Images sometimes freeze) I just bought it and it was updated right away to be compatible with recording, so I've been trying out some scheduled recordings, but I think it's also affected by the fact that it's an external drive with a 2.5 inch HDD, so it's in a situation where the image stops during playback or the frames skip.",
    "The user interface is never praised, and it is simply stated that \"you can watch 4K broadcasts\".",
    "By the way, it seems that you can only rewind the program you are recording, and I also accept this as a plus function that can record 4K to HDD.",
    "You might be disappointed if you buy it with high expectations, so don't expect too much.",
    "I hope it will be improved by the update.",
    "the heat retention function is okay.",

    "I installed it on the passenger side footwell of my compact car, and the fan noise is noticeable when the idling stops, but I don't feel it at all while driving.",
    "It still smelled like a chemical that was being vented out, so I had to open the window regularly to ventilate.",
    "As it is written in the review, the part where the shoulder strap passes through is very bad, so you need to fold the bar with a minus driver or something.",

    "The lid was also off when I opened the box.",
    "I recommend the product, but you might be better off buying it elsewhere.",
    "i'm worried about the strength, but for now",
    "I bought it because the support was not satisfactory after I changed the cover.",
    "It does its job in terms of stability, but because it's a fancy plastic product, it makes a nasty sound like \"mekeke (it's going to break)\" when you open and close the lid.",
    "You have to choose something that matches the thickness of the lid, so you have to be careful when you buy it.",
    "I love the cute back of the meatball",
    "I was looking for a bag to take my inu out for a walk, and was attracted to this stylish gray bag, so I purchased it.",
    "It was assembled in a modular style, and it was surprisingly light, so it didn't feel too heavy even though I was carrying it.",
    "The fan also moves smoothly and there are no catches.",
    "It looks like it will be fun even for a long trip.",
    "It's also very compact and easy to fold.",
    "Even when folded, the design of the meatball is visible, and it's cute when placed.",

    "First, I was attracted by the appearance and the low price, so I bought it immediately!",
    "I have a few other TSA locks that I like, but this one is handy.",
    "And as a celebrity who forgets their keys and loses things, I recommend Number Lock.",
    "But honestly, I put the most importance on the lightness, but if you want reliability and security, the fastener's place is a week, so it's made of cloth, so if you cut it with a knife, it will break instantly.",
    "Also, I want to have a combination of the fastener that is sweet.",
    "If you're overseas, I recommend bringing it on the plane.",
    "I used it on a bullet train trip and it was comfortable.",

    "It felt like my little finger was touching it.",
    "That's why I bought a 25cm one.",
    "when i opened it, it was big...",
    "I tried it on and it was a little loose even with socks.",
    "I was worried about returning it, but if it's too tight at 24.5, I'll just put it in the middle and wear it.",
    "I bought the team led and it's really good in bright red!",
    "Because there are many monochrome clothes of black and white, you will look brighter if you wear this!",

    "The Silverhawk 25 was leaking gas, and when I changed the valve, there was a problem where part of the tank was missing.  Using the [Bus Bond Q] to seal the tank and repair the grille, it was able to be shot smoothly.  If you want to buy this Colt 25, I would ask someone who can disassemble and reassemble it, or if you can't take a picture of it while disassembling it, I can",

    "There is no gap when attaching the bits, and I thought that this was a great price at 188 yen.",

    "I don't use it that often, but I think it's something that can be put in the toolbox.",
    "I also bought the same seller's \"1/4 inch hexagonal magnetic quick release driver, lowell, bit holder, 60/100/150 mm\".",
