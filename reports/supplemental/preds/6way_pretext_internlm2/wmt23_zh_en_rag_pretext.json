    "Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs as the restrictions on movement also restrict access to precursors and basic chemicals.",
    "Traffickers who are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.",

    "The changes brought about by Covid-19 are unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from previous crises.",
    "After the 2008 financial crisis, some drug users began to seek cheaper synthetic substances and switched to injecting drugs.",
    "Meanwhile, governments have been cutting budgets related to drugs.",
    "If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions to prevent drug use and related risky behaviors, as well as treatment services, may be severely affected.",
    "In addition, the priority of interdiction and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.",
    "Some countries have large amounts of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that the direct impact on drug trafficking in these countries will be the greatest.",
    "Methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs are often carried by couriers in carry-on bags or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Because almost all commercial air travel has been restricted, the supply of drugs by commercial aviation may be completely interrupted.",
    "Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the activities of drug trafficking using the dark web and parcel post may increase.",
    "In the long term, economic recession and associated containment measures may disrupt the drug market.",
    "As unemployment rates rise and opportunities dwindle, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to turn to harmful drug use, drug use disorders, and illicit activities related to drugs, whether production or trafficking.",

    "In the past two decades, the growth rate of drug use in developing countries has been far higher than that in developed countries.",
    "This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of young populations in developing countries.",
    "The proportion of teenagers and young adults in drug users is the largest.",

    "Drug use is more prevalent in urban than in rural areas in both developed and developing countries.",

    "Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.",

    "Cocaine and other drugs are more strongly associated with the world's wealthier regions.",
    "Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the more affluent social groups.",
    "But it is people with lower socioeconomic status who are more likely to develop a drug use disorder.",
    "data from a few countries suggest that harmful patterns of drug use and disorders are associated with low income .",
    "These patterns are less common in the more affluent social classes.",
    "The economic constraints imposed by the global Covid-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have previously been associated with increases in drug use, and this pandemic has forced millions of people around the world out of work.",
    "COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of the drug market The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, or because the control of the national authorities is weakened, or because more people may have to take risks in the economic crisis and engage in illegal activities.",
    "The related restrictions of COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, and the sea trafficking may have increased as a result, as the risk of interception is low and the amount of trafficking is more than that by air or land.",

    "In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not controlled internationally. Non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.",
    "Member States' domestic markets have an annual turnover of around 500 new psychoactive substances.",
    "At present, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.",
    "While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, only 2% were opioids, but this figure had risen to 9% by 2018.",
    "Many of the novel psychoactive substances in the class of opioids are fentanyl analogues, and their pharmacological and toxicological properties have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America, and to a lesser extent in other regions.",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine) and as a precursor for the manufacture of illicitly produced opioid analgesics.",
    "Some evidence suggests that injection of new psychoactive stimulants is also occurring in Europe: a study of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many contained substances that produce stimulant effects. \"",
    "2. The use of new psychoactive substances may become firmly entrenched in disadvantaged groups",
    "single new psychoactive substance has rarely formed a large market.",

    "Methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq grow",
    "As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.",
    "Crystal meth has become a major drug of concern alongside fentanyl and tramadol.",
    "A study in 2015 further confirmed these findings, with users saying that cannabis was harder to get than \"Captagon\" or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the International Narcotics Control Board has expressed concern about the large-scale import of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors by methamphetamine processing sites.",
    "In Afghanistan, the production of methamphetamine appears to have started in 2014.",

    "The jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis have seen an increase in cannabis use.",
    "Canada, Uruguay and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although similar trends have been observed in jurisdictions that have not legalized nonmedical cannabis use.",
    "In the two states in the United States that were the first to legalize cannabis for nonmedical use, Colorado and Washington, the prevalence of cannabis use among adults has increased, particularly in the past month and among those who use cannabis daily or almost daily, since 2012, exceeding the national average.",
    "All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, with use in the past month nearly doubling.",
    "This suggests that the increase is mainly due to more frequent and frequent use of cannabis.",
    "Short-term data from Canada also suggest that use increased as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019.",
    "However, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources in 2019.",
    "Has cannabis legalization caused a global drop in cannabis seizures?",
    "In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years, owing to a reduction in the quantity seized in North America, which fell by 84% over the past decade.",
    "By contrast, seizures in the rest of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalising the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.",
    "Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have had a dampening effect on the domestic market for new psychoactive substances, although it is difficult to assess the extent of this effect.",
    "Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different rates of use of these substances.",
    "In other countries, use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation.",
    "the use of drugs for pain management and palliative care is mainly provided in high @-@ income countries , and the distribution of these drugs is uneven across regions .",
    "in 2018 , more than 90 % of the medically available opioids were in high @-@ income countries .",
    "about 50% in North America , 40% in Europe , and 2% in Oceania .",
    "These countries account for approximately 12% of the world's population .",
    "It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but the consumption of pharmaceutical opioids is less than 10%.",
    "barriers to access to opioid analgesics are associated with many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices .",
    "People who are poorer are more likely to have a substance use disorder. In 2018, an estimated 3.56 million people had a substance use disorder.",
    "Poverty , limited education , and social marginalization may increase risk for substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences . This is supported by research in high @-@ income countries , which shows that an individual 's adverse socioeconomic trajectory -- not just their circumstances at a given point in time -- is associated with risk for substance use disorders .",
    "Substance use disorders also deepen social and economic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby perpetuating the cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.",

    "limited global data suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide .",
    "However, alcohol appears to have a greater role in violent events than drugs.",
    "Although drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this association can be partly attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment and peer influences.",
    "the link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted .",
    "if a stable criminal structure is in place , large @-@ scale organized crime activities , including international drug trafficking , may be carried out without violence .",
    "In the short term, the presence and extent of violence are more a function of changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized crime groups than of the volume of trafficking. These changes include fluctuations in the size of the illegal market, the death or incarceration of prominent criminals, and law enforcement actions that weaken one group relative to another.",

    "But the harms associated with opioids are often overlooked because of their lower prevalence.",
    "Of the estimated 167,000 deaths in 2017 associated with drug use disorders, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the 21 million years of healthy life lost to disability or premature death due to drug use were caused by these substances.",
    "Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis",
    "Tramadol is driving the opioid crisis in West, Central and North Africa, while fentanyl is the main driver in North America. These two regions have little in common in terms of economic, demographic or general patterns of drug use, but both are struggling with the opioid crisis fueled by the availability of cheap and easy-to-produce substances.",
    "In North America, the use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to a 20 @-@ year increase in opioid overdose deaths.",
    "Of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States in 2018 , two thirds involved fentanyl .",
    "Canada has reported similar results, albeit at a lower level.",

    "In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the market for nonmedical use of tramadol has grown substantially.",
    "In the region, the number of patients treated for tramadol use disorder is increasing.",
    "In 2017, global seizures of tramadol reached a peak of more than 125 tonnes.",
    "But in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.",
    "The two crises are driven by the ease of manufacture and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues and precursors.",
    "What makes these crises worse is that these substances are available in both the legal and illegal markets, making them harder to detect and prevent from being abused.",
    "Stimulant use on the rise",
    "The stimulant field is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.",

    "Based on the majority of indicators, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for the past 20 years.",

    "Q: Please ask Chongyang Investment to see how the US non-farm employment data in January is far beyond expectations and future trends?",
    "On February 3, the US Department of Labor released the non-farm employment data of January 2023. The number of new non-farm jobs was 517,000, which was far higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, which was the lowest in the past 50 years; the year-on-year growth rate of hourly wages was 4.4%, and the month-on-month growth rate was 0.3%,",
    "From the total amount, this data is affected by many one-time and technical factors, such as the return of striking teachers and workers, the revision of the survey and statistical perspective, and the update of seasonal factors. It may be revised later (refer to the revision of the number of new non-agricultural employment in January 2022 from 504,000 to 364,000), and the non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as the data shows.",
    "From the perspective of structure, the impact of high-tech enterprises on layoffs still exists, but the proportion is low; the new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels and education and health care has risen sharply, and the data shows that the labor force gap in the service industry still exists.",
    "The rise of service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor shortage data, which are far beyond expectations, as well as the strong consumption credit data, we judge that the US service industry has experienced a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.",
    "We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US labor market cannot be improved without a recession.",
    "Currently, the US labor market has a supply gap of more than 5 million, while the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old has approached the pre-epidemic high point.",
    "In addition, due to the strong excess savings and consumer credit of American residents, the strong consumption demand will further delay the impact of tightening policy on the labor market.",
    "The tight supply and demand in the US labor market will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.",
    "Adding to the fact that the interest rate hike is close to the end, and the inflation expectation keeps fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline of wage growth.",
    "Before the release of this data, the U.S. stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the path of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.",
    "As inflation data continued to improve, the Fed shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market ignored the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, not only expecting to stop raising interest rates, but also expecting two rate cuts by the end of the year.",
    "In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and uncertain impact of tightening policy, we believe that the Fed's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme expectations and trading congestion may cause some damage to the market.",
    "However, the stubbornness of wage growth will not change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative and the leading indicators of various CPI items gradually improving, the U.S. CPI data has turned to a rapid decline phase since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to disprove. After the next inflation data is released, the market may enter a new round of bargaining.<",

    "Then... fell into the pit.",
    "The whole book is relatively light and enjoyable. In the early part of the book, when Ye Shu was still in the online game, even though there were conflicts between guilds, they were often resolved by Ye Shu's bloodthirsty actions, so they were not heavy.",

    "The full-time description of characters and love lines is very impressive. Some characters are only mentioned occasionally, but they leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters such as Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian and Su Mu Orange have a large number of fans. However, the characters such as Jiang Bota and Chu Yunxiu, who are not the focus of the writing, are also very likable. In an electronic game novel, it is difficult to find a character that people",
    "And in the love line, full-time also has no general web novel to be criticized by the harem of 3000 concubines, either beautiful or gay, the feelings of all people, all have a common place, that is they like the game of glory, and most of them want to win in a fair way.",

    "I think it is acceptable. Firstly, it is cheap, and the 700 pages are divided into two books, which is convenient for reading; secondly, it is different from the Michelangelo's complete works, which is dominated by paintings. The black and white manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci occupy the majority of this book. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this version is the most cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.",
    "The explanation of the painting is great, including the analysis of composition, draft and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know whether it is printing or book size problem, some shadows are too deep, and the details are not clear, which is a pity.",
    "3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.",
    "The former is a genius, and the latter is too broad and too high to be described as a genius.",

    "And finally, they are collected together and named as \u201cWhat We Talk About When We Talk About Love\u201d.",
    "I think this collection of short stories and its title is like a performance art. The author wants to express that love is not only the ups and downs on the stage, the legends of the city, nor the sticky glue of you and me. Love is not only represented by the above nor should it be represented by the above. Love is also the life of the plain water, the dull day after day, the helplessness of life, the escape from reality, and the confusion of the future.<",
    "When you read this book, you may recall the quarreling couple around you, the dull marriage of people you know, and the unsatisfactory love affairs.",
    "This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it. From the perspective of aesthetics, the writing and plot of this book are dull and tasteless. Unless your life is full of ups and downs or sweet as living in a candy castle, you will feel bored and indifferent when reading it.",
    "And from the perspective of thought depth, the daily scenes did not make people open their eyes or expand their thoughts and views (this is different from Marquez's \"Love in the Time of Cholera\"), and the short fragments did not discuss any problems, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?",
    "Reason for marriage breakdown",
    "So I would not recommend you to read this book. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you read it or not.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres than through the plot, which is the reason why the reading experience of this book is not good.",
    "It is suitable for a quick read, but not for a careful reading.",
    "The logic of the book is good, but the content is not enough.",
    "It explains a lot of sales theories, what they are and why, but it is weak in how to do it. It only points out the direction but does not give specific methods.",
    "Also, this book feels like a patchwork.",
    "They come from the earth and, unlike canvas and oil, they give grudgingly.",

    "A quick guide to internet finance",
    "This book is very shallow, and can be said to be only an introductory course, which can help everyone quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to deeply understand it, you still have to follow the clues and dig it yourself.",
    "Moreover, the book was published at an early time, and the content of the Alipay WeChat loan subsidy war that cultivates user habits was not mentioned, and the current third-party payment share is probably not as small as the book said.",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat with their mobile phones. Merchants also give up using UnionPay because of the high bank flow.",
    "But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is obvious that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the history of domestic and foreign financial development. That is why he can write such easy-to-understand contents.",

    "The author elaborates five languages of appreciation in this book: affirmative words, quality time, service, gifts, and physical touch.",
    "I think it is not important that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether they are your family, friends or colleagues, at any time and place.",
    "In fact, the closer the relationship is, the more appreciation and gratitude is needed. Only in this way can our life become more beautiful.",
    "If you learn to appreciate others, you can retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.",
    "We would like to give thanks to the translators for bringing us the wonderful thoughts and the world from abroad.",
    "Due to the cultural background of the East and the West, there will be some differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the original version of the author, you will gain more.",
    "Thank you again for the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!",
    "I suspect that this is a counterfeit product. Please have Amazon strictly review it.",
    "The quality is super bad, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and it is even worse than the products on the roadside stalls, there is no weight, no barcode, and the packaging of ten bags is also loose, which is not the characteristics of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience of Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is a quality problem; I suggest that the merchant should open his eyes and refuse to sell inferior goods; supplement: I",

    "I tried it in the office for a day, and the whole room was filled with this plastic smell.",

After all, it is a food packaging that is too simple, and it is still an international purchase. There is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark. It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that the honey inside the lid directly comes out from the inside. There is almost no ad",

It's not only the problem of the sound on one side being louder than the other, but also the bass effect is not as good as the one I had before. There are also some noises.

    "I checked the order status on Amazon, but the seller did not provide the express number, so I couldn\u2019t find out where the order was.",
    "So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide the express delivery number, but I didn't get a reply for two days.",
    "I had no choice but to call Amazon customer service. The customer service told me the seller's mobile phone number. I called the seller again. After several calls, the phone was finally answered. I was told that the express was lost. I could immediately re-send me one.",
    "Although I was very angry, but because the computer urgently needed, so I didn't say much to the seller, as long as he sent it to me immediately.",
    "So I called the next day to ask if it had been shipped.",

    "Could you tell me the order number?",
    "The seller said that the goods had not been sent out, and told me that if I was in a hurry, I could order from another place, and if I could wait, the goods would be sent out in the afternoon.",
    "I could not move far or fast.",
    "I can only ask the seller to send the goods as soon as possible.",
    "Finally, after countless phone calls, I received my computer on October 16th.",
    "As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for someone else, I will add comments later.",
    "I bought it half a year ago, but I didn't use it for a few times. Now it has contact failure. I asked if I could repair it?",
    "I bought it because I have a desktop computer, so I haven't used it much.",
    "Just take it with me when I go on business trips and use it a few times.",
    "Recently, I found that when connecting to the power source, it will not charge, and I need to hold the charger and the line connection with my hands left and right to charge.",
    "I suspect that the interface is not in contact, and I wonder if it can be repaired now?",
    "I strongly recommend that Amazon stop using EMS!",
    "The product is five stars, the logistics is one star, and the average is three stars.",
    "I don't know why Amazon uses EMS. It is not reliable in the industry. Well, the computer is a valuable item, after all!",

    "On the morning of the 22nd, I checked the logistics and finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to receive the goods happily. However, in the evening, without receiving any phone call or text message, I checked the logistics and found that it was signed in the middle of the day, and it was even signed by myself!",

    "First of all, I found that the price was reduced after I bought it for a few days. Bad review. It was good and the price/performance ratio was high.

    "The goods are good, but the platform bureaucracy remains",
    "The hard disk is of excellent quality and the price-performance ratio is definitely high. It is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I definitely recommend you to buy it.",
    "But I have to say that the Amazon platform is still bureaucratic. It has not improved since I swore that I would never use it a few years ago. You can never find the actual logistics status. The information is always sent after several weeks. You can never complain. It is just so bureaucratic!",
    "I have received the goods for several days, but the logistics information is still that you will receive the goods in 10 or so days!",

When I opened it, the cardboard inside was damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else. I gave it to my husband to try it out before the warranty period ended. The machine had no power. Fortunately, there was no hair in the blade. If there",

    "I will buy it again. If it is still fake, I will hold you responsible.",
    "It's a crossbar!",

    "Addition: I compared the UN series insole (I threw the shoes away and kept the insole) with the previous one today. The material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before. It is just a fake softness.",
    "My instep is not high, and the part that is uncomfortable is about 3 cm forward from the highest part of the instep.",

    "The shoe size is a little bit bigger, 25 feet long 10.5 wide, 7.5W, the foot is a little bit loose, but I like to wear loose shoes, and I put a pair of insoles in the shoes.",
    "Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not worth mentioning. One of the soles has a crack, and the other has various scratches and a needle hole. The adhesive strip at the connection between the shoe face and the sole is misaligned. It is obviously a case of passing off the worse for the better!",
    "I often regret selling them...",
    "I bought it for 280 yuan during the promotion, which is a good bargain for ASICS. Of course, there are even lower prices in the comments.",
    "Now let's talk about the shoes. The advantages: the shoes are very light, running is quite comfortable, and it is quite a good fit, not loose and sloppy.",
    "The appearance is very good, but the disadvantages are also obvious: I usually wear shoes of size 40, but this time I bought size 40.5. The front of the shoe is about 1 thumb length away from the toe, but this does not affect anything.",
    "This shoe is very \"narrow\", although there is still a distance in front, but it feels tight.",
    "There is another thing, the shoes may not be breathable, so my feet feel hot now.",
    "While running they would put more pressure on their heels.",
    "First of all, the shoes are well made, worth the price.",
    "My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, shoes uk6.5, I have also bought several pairs of Amazon's Aipu, and I have never had any problems with them. However, I bought a size larger uk7, and after putting them on, the length was obviously too long, but because the insole was too thick, it still pressed the instep hard, and because the hiking shoes were very hard, it was very uncomfortable",
    "If your feet are not particularly thin, I don't recommend buying this model.",
    "If you really want to buy it, you can solve the problem by changing the insole, but the original insole looks very high-end, and it's a pity not to use it.",
    "Received the bag, very happy shopping.",
    "Very satisfied, very like, Amazon overseas purchases are all genuine products without doubt, the quality is also very good, good quality and cheap, buy with confidence, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude are all very friendly and pleasant, dealing with problems patiently and efficiently, perfect solution to the worries after the sale, the delivery service is very convenient and reliable, the delivery man is very considerate for the customer, and always remind to take the goods from the express cabinet in time",

    "When I wanted to use it in spring, I found that I couldn't connect it to the wristband. Both devices' manuals said that they supported each other. Later, I found that it was probably a problem with the heart rate monitor, because I still couldn't connect it to other devices.",
    "I called Amazon, and they told me to contact the agent company. The agent company told me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.",
    "After nearly half a month, the thing was sent back to me as it was, and even the express box was the one I sent out!",
    "There was no reply, no receipt and no test report!",
    "For whatever you want, good or bad.",
    "I called to ask, and they said that the equipment was fine and was returned to me.",
    "But I still can't connect, the agent company said: it's not their business.",

    "Size, logistics",

    "I\u2019d like to say something about the packaging. It\u2019s just wrapped with a few layers of plastic film. There is no packaging plastic bubble paper inside. When I opened it, all the parts were just put in the empty box. Fortunately, the toy quality is good. There are no broken parts. It\u2019s just smaller than I expected. Because it doesn\u2019t have batteries, it often goes off the track. I feel that the gap between the two rails is too big.",

In other words, it is a fake product. I am not saying it is difficult to hear. Look, it is a clear quality problem (the number is not displayed completely). They sell it. Is it garbage?",
    "I contacted the seller, who gave a lot of reasons, and blamed me for buying their products in the first place. Such products, such sellers, such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.",

The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the material is sufficient, and it is also an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It is incomparable to the so-called mechanical watches of several hundred yuan. This is a genuine product.",
