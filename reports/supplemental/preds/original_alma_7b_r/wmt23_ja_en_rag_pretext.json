    "This cartoon is difficult to understand.",
    "Then, you go after him with your tools. I tried to do that, but I couldn't get the picture to move smoothly. I guess I just didn't try hard enough.",
    "Is it easy for people who are used to DS to use it?",
    "It's not that you can't like a character in a manga, but you can't like them all, and DS is like that too, in a way. You can't get to know them, or feel a sense of closeness to them.",
    "The methods of calculation are also such that they are like competing for time and are like questions that you can answer correctly in a certain amount of time.",
    "I understand the urge to rush to take tests, but is it possible to solve them without getting stressed out?",
    "The final whistle may not be your cup of tea either.",
    "Is it okay to make it sound more pleasant if you work hard all your life?\"",
    "It seems like 6,200 yen has been spent somehow.",
    "Can you tell me the price for half of that?",
    "Sorry, I didn't mean to make it into two comments.",
    "This song is still cool, admit it.",
    "The ED of Persona 3 reached \u30d8\u309a\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca3.",
    "I played 5 in the middle of the game.",
    "Haru Sona 4 is finished with the hawthorn in vita.",
    "There is no change from the previous work, Persona 4.",
    "There is no story, and it feels shorter than the previous one.",
    "The song is so cute!",
    "Listen and you'll feel the difference!",
    "The characters from Persona 3 were first HD-ized, and I was moved very much when I saw them for the first time.",
    "I didn't expect Persona 5 to look so beautiful (laugh). It's a beautiful place from the start, but the freshness is ... well, if you think about it, Ikemen 3 is quite pleasant.",
    "As a sound, I found it easier to play than 3, but not as easy as 5.",
    "Persona 3 was either green or blue, and it seemed darker than the background.",
    "5 is a bright color, such as red and yellow, and looks good against a background.",
    "The assist function is rich in content, so I think even those who dislike poker can enjoy it.",
    "With an experienced operator, the cats become a clear target.",
    "Triple Puck Hockey has a sound track, but it is not as extensive as the one in the game, and for those who like the songs of Santolla, I recommend this one.",
    "It's such a pity.",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the photo's text plate. The real thing is similar to a black or blue Chacolette.",
    "And there wasn't a double choir.",
    "I was thinking about buying a Coeur de Lion, but for now, it is on hold. It's not too expensive, is it?",
    "I received a message requesting a new product in exchange for the product listed in the Lekki column after it was published there.",
    "The follow-up was handled quickly.",
    "I think the response to the affordable products was very good.",
    "There are four responses: 4 stars, a note, and afterward, I purchased a gold coin.",
    "The colors are just as beautiful as they look in the photos.",
    "However, it is not a buckle or a double-locking piece of the engraved brand logo, and the difference from the explanatory photograph is obvious.",
    "That's pitiful.",
    "In the evening, it will be heavier.",
    "I used the iPhone 7s from SIM Free.",
    "Since I did not know how to set up the first time, I asked a lady at the SK counter at Incheon Airport about how to do it (settings > data roaming > enable data roaming from the data option), and it worked out well.",
    "The attached explanation wasn't very relevant, it seems...?",
    "The reception in the area around Kansai International Airport is terrible, so I managed to get 3G on my phone.",
    "When I was in the city, I got 4G.",
    "At night or in the evening, the communication sometimes becomes heavy, and I wonder if I had reached the maximum limit of 100 MB per day.",
    "It's better than I thought.",
    "I was using Sony Xperia z for two years, then I switched to Ymobile and Xperia became unreliable, so I was looking for a new phone that I could use, and I found this mobile phone that can be used as a smartphone, which I bought.",
    "I was concerned that it wouldn't work with Mobile Suica, but it was fine.",
    "I got the impression that the size, weight, and Jack Silver were the ones I bought from the iPhone6.",
    "GAME does not have the same processing speed as the Z4, but it is a little faster, and I had the impression that the fingerprint recognition was slow, and that it takes a little time to recognize faces. I am using the face recognition though.",
    "I thought the iPhone would be amazing, but I was very satisfied with the Android V9 purchase.",
    "I'd like to point out that it would be nice if it were a little smaller. There are no strap-holes, but I can deal with it with a case that has them. I haven't tested its waterproofness. It's a little heavier, but I haven't used it much. I would recommend it."
