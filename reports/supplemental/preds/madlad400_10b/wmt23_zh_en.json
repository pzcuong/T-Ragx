    "The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.",
    "In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health-care systems to the point of collapse, and government restrictions have disrupted the global economy.",
    "The impact of the pandemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be far-reaching.",
    "Some producers may be forced to look for new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.",
    "Traffickers who are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions may have to look for new routes and methods.",
    "Patterns of drug use and supply may change, and governments' ability to respond may be hampered.",
    "The shift brought by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from past crises.",
    "After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, and their use patterns shifted to injecting drugs.",
    "At the same time, governments cut drug-related budgets.",
    "If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, interventions to prevent drug use and related risky behaviour, and drug treatment services, could be severely affected.",
    "In addition, the priority of interception and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to move.",
    "Countries with large amounts of drugs smuggled through commercial flights are expected to be most directly affected by drug trafficking.",
    "Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in handbags or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities.With restrictions on air passenger transport imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely disrupted.",
    "Despite the disruption of international postal supply chains, the use of dark web and freight mail for trafficking is likely to increase.",
    "In the long run, economic recession and related closures may disrupt the drug market.",
    "With rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people are more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug-related disorders, and turn to illicit activities related to drugs, whether production or transportation.",
    "Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to grow their ranks.",
    "As government capacity to respond decreases, these shifts are likely to take root rapidly, becoming new realities in many communities.",
    "Expansion and complexity",
    "Market growth",
    "And the population pattern explains part of the market expansion.",
    "Drug use is increasing worldwide, both in terms of overall numbers and as a proportion of the world's population.",
    "An estimated 210 million people used drugs in 2009, or 4.8% of the global population aged 15\u201364, compared to an estimated 269 million people in 2018, or 5.3% of that population.",
    "Over the past two decades, drug use has grown much faster in developing countries than in developed countries.",
    "This reflects partly the difference in overall population growth over the period, 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of younger populations in developing countries.",
    "Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.",
    "Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while it decreased by 10% in developed countries.",
    "1 Urbanization is a driver of the current and future drug markets",
    "In both developed and developing countries, urban areas are more affected than rural areas.",
    "The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale migration of people from rural to urban areas. More than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, up from 34 per cent in 1960.",
    "Urbanization may be a key factor in future drug market dynamics, especially in developing countries where urbanization is more pronounced.",
    "Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the burden of the disease is borne by the poorest. Drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.",
    "Drugs such as cocaine are strongly associated with the wealthier regions of the world.",
    "Similarly, within countries, drug use is more prevalent among the wealthy.",
    "However, the rate of people who develop substance abuse disorders is higher among those of lower socio-economic status.",
    "Data from a few countries suggest that there is a link between harmful drug use patterns and illness and low income.",
    "These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier social classes.",
    "The economic constraints imposed by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to increases in drug use, and the pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide out of work.",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers growing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of the reduced ability of national authorities to control it, or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.",
    "The decline in air and land trafficking due to COVID-19 restrictions may have increased trafficking by sea, which is less likely to be intercepted and more likely to be smuggled than by air or land.",
    "Recently, there have been reports of cocaine cargoes being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea.",
    "Complexity enhancement",
    "The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but new opioids with potential harm are proliferating and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.",
    "Hundreds of synthetic drugs, many of which are not under international control, have been added to the list, along with plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin.",
    "About 500 new active substances are introduced to the domestic markets of member countries each year.",
    "Most of these are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of opioids.",
    "While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.",
    "Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioid-type new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, that figure had risen to 9%.",
    "Many of the new opioid psychoactive substances are fentanyl analogues, whose efficacy and harmfulness have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America and to a lesser extent in other regions.",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as a compound in heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and in the manufacture of counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.",
    "Some evidence suggests that the phenomenon of injecting NSA stimulants is also occurring in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with NSAs that produce stimulant effects.",
    "2. New psychoactive substance use may be becoming more pervasive in vulnerable populations",
    "A single class of new psychoactive substances rarely forms a large market.",
    "But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabis is a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.",
    "Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.",
    "Control of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals that are most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and \"shabu\" have been placed under international control.",
    "Drug traffickers and producers have been looking for alternatives, not only less controlled substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, known as \"custom precursors\".",
    "Restrictive measures aimed at halting the spread of COVID-19 are likely to put further pressure on drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.",
    "Evidence from Mexico suggests that this is already a reality: in March 2020, shortages of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia reportedly drove up methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.",
    "The market is very dynamic.",
    "Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation",
    "The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.",
    "The amount of opioids intercepted by Russian authorities has dropped by about 80%, and the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has dropped dramatically.",
    "But the stimulant market seems to be booming.",
    "There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrroloquinoline quinone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.",
    "Russian authorities reported a sharp increase in the number of recently discovered clandestine laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 in 2018.",
    "Growth in methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq",
    "As early as 2012, surveys of staff in hospitals, prisons and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.",
    "Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern alongside fentanyl and tramadol.",
    "A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users reporting that cannabis was more difficult to obtain than \"phenethylamine\" or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, the Iraqi authorities discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the Board has expressed concern about the import of large quantities of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors in a methamphetamine processing site.",
    "In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have begun in 2014.",
    "Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.",
    "But the first half of 2019 saw a record 657 kilograms of heroin seized \u2013 a sharp increase from the previous year.",
    "Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate in Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that production in that country is rapidly increasing.",
    "Policy changes and trends",
    "Most jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical cannabis use have seen cannabis use increase.",
    "Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although similar trends have been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of cannabis.",
    "In Colorado and Washington, the two states that first passed legislation, non-medical use of cannabis by adults has increased, especially in the past month and daily or almost daily use, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, with use almost doubling in the past month.",
    "This suggests that the increase is mainly due to frequent and frequent use of cannabis.",
    "Short-term data from Canada also show that the legal market expanded in 2018 and 2019, and that usage increased.",
    "However, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources in 2019.",
    "Is the reason behind the global cannabis seizures plummet legalization of cannabis?",
    "Global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, driven by a decline in North America, which has seen seizures drop by 84% over the past 10 years.",
    "In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period.The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.",
    "Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect.",
    "Countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use of new psychoactive substances.",
    "In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following the adoption of national legislation.",
    "Vulnerable groups face harm from both the legal and illegal drug markets.",
    "In 2018, more than 90% of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.",
    "About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.",
    "These countries account for about 12% of the world's population.",
    "It is estimated that while low- and middle-income countries account for 88% of the world's population, they consume less than 10% of the world's medical opioids.",
    "Barriers to access to medical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.",
    "People who are poorer are at greater risk of drug use disorders, with an estimated 35.6 million people suffering from drug use disorders in 2018.",
    "Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences.Studies in high-income countries confirm this, in which individuals' unfavourable socioeconomic trajectories are not only related to their situation at a given time, but also to the risk of drug use disorders.",
    "Drug-related disorders also deepen socioeconomic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fuelling a vicious circle of disadvantage.These outcomes may also be related to stigmatization and consequences within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, people with a diverse sexual orientation, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug-related disorders or have problems accessing treatment services.",
    "The impact of harmful drug use on society at large has increased over the past decade, according to the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) index, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death.",
    "Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life expectancy attributable to drug use increased by 17%.",
    "The increase in disability-adjusted life expectancy associated with liver cancer due to untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, is particularly high\u2014up to 40%.",
    "The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal links between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.",
    "Limited data on a global scale suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.",
    "But alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs in violence.",
    "While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this association can be partly attributed to a variety of mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.",
    "The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, can be carried out without violence where stable criminal structures exist.",
    "In the short term, the existence and degree of violence depends less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of prominent criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.",
    "Latest trends",
    "Cannabis is the most commonly used substance, opioids are the most harmful",
    "It is estimated that 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug worldwide.",
    "In contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "But the harm associated with opioids is overlooked because of the small number of users.",
    "Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were attributed to these substances, and 50% of the 21 million life years believed to be lost due to disability or premature death from drug use.",
    "The non-medical use of synthetic opioids is adding to the public health crisis.",
    "In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis is fueled by tramadol; in North America, by fentanyl.The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or general drug use patterns, but are struggling with an opioid crisis fueled by substances that are easily available and cheap to produce.",
    "In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.",
    "In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths recorded in the United States were related to fentanyl.",
    "Canada reported similar results, but in lower numbers.",
    "The overdose deaths from fentanyl are partly due to the unpredictable effects of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.",
    "In West, Central and North Africa, the market for non-medical tramadol has grown significantly.",
    "In the region, the number of patients receiving treatment for tramadol use disorders is increasing.",
    "In 2017, the number of tramadol intercepted worldwide increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "But in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate tramadol, global seizures dropped to 32 tons.",
    "The crisis in both countries was fueled by the ease and low cost of manufacture, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.",
    "The crisis in both countries is compounded by the fact that these substances are available both on the pharmaceutical and the illicit markets, making their abuse more difficult to detect and prevent.",
    "Stimulant use is on the rise.",
    "The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in their primary markets.",
    "About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, with the highest prevalence in North America and Western Europe.",
    "Amphetamine was used by about 27 million people in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to most available indicators, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions over the past 20 years.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that the increase in one drug use decreases the use of the other, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the demand of the same market.",
    "COVID-19 increases risks for injecting drug users",
    "It is estimated that approximately 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, accounting for about 10% of global HIV infections.",
    "More than 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated among injecting drug users.",
    "5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.",
    "More harmful uses may emerge as some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently.",

    "According to the AFP, on February 10, at the latest EU summit, European Commission President Von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to expel illegal immigrants.",
    "The move is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core problem is that few illegal immigrants are eventually returned.",
