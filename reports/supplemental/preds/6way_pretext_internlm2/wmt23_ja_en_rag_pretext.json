    "(It will finally make the shampoo work properly) Well, in short, it's a double wash, haha. The shampoo itself has a small capacity, so the trick is to use less of it for the first wash... I'm satisfied with the shampoo's effect itself.",
    "I bought a more expensive shampoo up to this point, but I felt that the touch of my hair had improved.",

    "It's solar powered so there's no need to pay for electricity, but it doesn't turn on until morning in winter, so I've also installed 3 100V human detection LED sensors.",
    "With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30m where we can recognize a human shadow.",
    "Also, for daytime crime prevention, I think that if you feel that the deterrent effect is weak because the camera is small, you need to work on a cover.",
    "I have a sticker that says \"Security camera in operation 24 hours a day\".",
    "It's an original product from a security camera manufacturer that I used before.",

    "There is one spare nut.",

    "First, I was worried because the oil was not coming off the hex wrench and the main body was white, so I thought it was oiled.",
    "It took 40 minutes to assemble.",
    "I completed the assembly and confirmed the product.",
    "The hardness of the up and down of the spring type armrest is different on the left and right, and the left is heavy and the right is light, so the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).",
    "The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and the fixed force is weak, so it falls down quickly with a \"kachi\" sound.",
    "The seat is made of non-renewable high-density urethane foam, which feels hard, and the seating comfort is poor (is the springiness weak?",
    ") The backrest part of the competition mesh is harder and thinner than other mesh chairs, so it hurts the back.",
    "Although it's a small detail, the height from the seat to the ground was 550mm instead of 530mm (the height of the seat is important for tall people). Also, the part of the chair that is supported by casters is not made of steel, so there are doubts about its durability.",
    "I bought a separate cushion to put on it, and I use a towel to cover the mesh fabric part because it seems like it will deteriorate (get damaged) quickly.",
    "I felt that the fit of the back was good for me, who is 186cm and 80kg, but I felt that the overall satisfaction was low and that it was a product that was not worth the price.",
    "Of course, it's better to try out an office chair before buying it.",
    "I received an email from the manufacturer asking if I would like to purchase the armrest and headrest, so should I ask about them?",
    "They are also discussed.)",
    "This story just is, well, what it is.",
    "I bought a cheap Pixelsa 4K tuner because it seems that I can see the right rotation BS4K in my house.",
    "As an experiment, I can see the free broadcast starting with NHK BS4K, and at the same time, I can enjoy it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV I bought.",
    "(The picture sometimes becomes blurry) I have been able to watch a few scheduled recordings since the update came soon after the purchase, but I think it is because of the 2.5 inch HDD external drive, but the picture stops and the frame skips when I play it back.",
    "The user interface is also not something that has ever been praised, and it simply says \"can watch 4K broadcasts\".",
    "By the way, during scheduled recording, it seems that you can only rewind the recorded programme, so I accept this as a plus function that you can record in 4K on the HDD.",
    "I think that people who expect too much and buy it will be disappointed, so it's better not to expect too much.",
    "I hope it will be improved by the update.",
    "The warming function is OK",
    "I haven't used the insulation function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it warmed up in about 2 hours and was hot after about 2.5 hours.",
    "I used it on the passenger seat footrest of a compact car. The fan noise is noticeable when idle, but it's not noticeable at all while driving.",
    "It's still new, so there's a smell like a chemical substance being emitted from the fan that I noticed, so I had to open the windows regularly for ventilation.",
    "As written in the review, the part where the short wire is connected is very bad, so you need to bend the barrell to make it easier to connect.",
    "So is your iPhone really damaged?",
    "I started using it two months ago and it suddenly broke today.",
    "I liked the feel and size of the keys, but it's no good if it breaks.",
    "I work in a job that involves processing images all day long, and the volume automatically goes up to 100%.",
    "Even if I lower it, it goes back to 100% in an instant.",
    "I can't use earphones because they hurt my ears, and the volume is too loud for me to use my PC at night.",
    "Every few seconds, it sends a signal and repeats the volume display appearing and disappearing on the computer screen.",
    "In addition, the mouse's instructions are obstructed by the keyboard, so you can't use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard every time.",
    "The enter key and backspace key also stopped working.",
    "I don't recommend it at all, but if it's around 1,000 yen, you might as well try it.",
    "If you're lucky, you might be able to use it for about half a year.",
    "Other companies also offer 1 year to 3 year warranties at the same price range, but this one only offers a 6 month warranty.",
    "The short warranty period implies that it is fragile.",
    "The product is the best, but the packaging is the worst.",
    "I love the product, but the color is different from what I usually use.",
    "I highly recommend to those who are looking for a food storage container!!",
    "However, there were gaps as big as a large cardboard box, and the packaging was the worst, and there was no delivery slip.",
    "When I opened the box, the lid was also missing.",
    "I recommend the product, but it might be better to buy it elsewhere.",
    "I'm worried about the strength, but",
    "I bought it because I was worried about the support when I bought a new lid.",
    "It fulfills its role as a lid, but as it is a luxurious plastic product, it makes a nasty sound like 'mekeke (it's going to break)' when you open and close the lid.",
    "You have to choose something that matches the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when you buy it.",
    "I love the cute buckle",
    "I was looking for a backpack to take my dog out, and I was attracted to this stylish gray backpack, so I bought it here.",
    "It's a built-in style, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so I felt that it wasn't that heavy to carry.",
    "The fastener also moves smoothly and there are no catches.",
    "Even long distance travel seems to be comfortable.",
    "It is very compact and easy to fold.",
    "Even when folded up, the design of the paw is visible, and it looks cute when placed down.",
    "Light and comfortable!",
    "The pulleys are also easy to use",
    "First, I was immediately attracted to the appearance and the low price, so I bought it right away!",
    "I have several TSA locks that I've liked for several years, but they're convenient, aren't they?",
    "And as a famous person who forgets keys and loses them, I recommend the number lock.",
    "I'm just being honest, but I put the most importance on the lightness, so it's good, but if you want it to be sturdy and secure, you can get it from the hardware store for a week, and it's made of cloth, so it can be cut with a knife in an instant.",
    "Also, I want to have a keyring that is easy to open and close, so I want to have a keyring that is easy to open and close.",
    "If you're overseas, I recommend it for carry-on luggage.",
    "I used it on the Shinkansen and it was comfortable.",
    "It's difficult to choose the size...",
    "I have a hard time buying shoes because of the wide range of sizes.",
    "I wear a size 24cm for Converse and Banana Republic.",
    "MRL996\u308224cm\u3002",
    "I thought it was uncomfortable at first, but I got used to it.",
    "This time, I tried the ML574, and my sister said that 24.5cm was too tight, so I tried it on, and it was definitely too tight.",
    "It felt like my little finger was touching.",
    "I bought a size 25cm for that reason.",
    "When I received and opened it, it was too big...",
    "I tried them on and even with socks they were a little loose.",
    "I was worried about returning it, but if I got the 24.5 and it was still too tight, it would be a hassle, so I think I'll put an insole in and wear it as is.",
    "I bought the team red and it's really nice in a bright red!",
    "I have a lot of black and white monochrome clothes, so when I wear these, I feel brighter!",
    "165cm, men in their 40s",
    "I ordered an L size, but I recommend the M size for the following specs.",
    "Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Chest: 100 cm Typical belly",
    "(Stretchy) When I wear it underwater, the waist part is loose, so the rush guard goes up.",
    "I'm swimming while fixing the part that's peeled up.",
    "Especially when I'm careless with my diet, my belly becomes round.",
    "Also, when I walk while moving up and down violently, my stomach is pushed up from below.",
    "<Construction of the product> The fabric is sturdy and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about the nipples showing through.",
    "I think that if you buy a smaller size, you will be satisfied with this price.",
    "I guess it did leak gas after all...",
    "The Silvia Cort25 did have a gas leak, but after exchanging the valve, there was a problem where the tank was missing a part, but after using the [Vent Q] to seal the tank and repair the gas leak, it was able to be used normally. I would recommend this Cort25 to people who can disassemble and reassemble it, but if you don't have confidence, I wouldn't recommend it because you have to take it apart while taking pictures.",
    "I thought it would be of poor quality for 188 yen",
    "Early return and torque can be used separately.",
    "Light, small, and above all, the simplicity without any pretense is nice.",
    "There's no gap when you attach the bit, and I thought it was a great price at 188 yen.",
    "Well, how long will it last?",
    "I don't think I'll use it that often, but I think it's something that can be kept in a toolbox.",
    "I purchased this along with the \"1/4 inch hexagonal wrench magnetic quick release driver rowlet bit holder 60/100/150 mm\" from the same seller.",
    "I had no problems with this, and it was a good value for the price.",
    "The controller won't move",
    "Sometimes the plane moves on its own and can't be controlled.",
    "If you reconnect the cable, you can operate it, but after a few minutes, it will suddenly move in an unnatural direction and you won't be able to operate it.",
    "I don't recommend buying this product.",
    "I would like to warn everyone in advance.",
    "It's a terrible product.",
    "It's wired, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It has high reliability and can be used for a long time without breaking.",
    "You can also use the available computers and card games as much as you\u2019d like.",
    "\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb Afternote: I returned it as a defective product within one month, and I was able to get a refund for the Amazon gift card, so I think it was good in that regard.",
    "Will this increase your calculation power?",
    "I think it's a child who understands the calculation.",
    "It's not impossible for a child who can understand some calculations, right?",
    "I can't solve the problem.",
    "Also, when giving tools to parents, I ask them to point to the screen and move it up, but I tried it myself and it didn't go smoothly no matter how many times I tried.",
    "The point is that it might be easier to let someone who is used to the DS do it.",
    "I can't get into the illustrations of manga characters, or maybe it's because I get into the fun of the screen, like DS, but for some reason I can't get close to them.",
    "It's a way to compete with time, for example, how many questions can you answer in a certain amount of time.",
    "I understand the feeling of being rushed in a test, but... wouldn't it be better to not make them feel rushed and just have them calculate?",
    "Even when it's over, I don't like the sound of the gong.",
    "I'm working hard, but can't you make the sound more pleasant?",
    "I feel like I've lost money with this, 6,200 yen.",
    "I understand the price of this half.",
    "I'm sorry, I accidentally translated this as \u26062.",
    "I really like the songs by Persona!",
    "I got to the ED of Persona 3.",
    "I played up to 5.",
    "Persona 4 is done on the Vita.",
    "There's nothing different from the previous Persona 4.",
    "The story is short, so it feels shorter than the previous one.",
    "The music is really cool!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "The characters in Persona 3 were the first to be HDized, so I was moved when I saw them for the first time.",
    "It looks much cleaner without carpet.",
    "As a game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is mainly blue, but the background was too dark to see.",
    "5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it overlaps with the background.",
    "The assist function is rich, so I think even those who are bad at music games can play.",
    "For those who are good at audio games, the challenge function will make it a game that is difficult to play.",
    "Triple Puck has a soundtrack, but it's not just a bunch of filler songs, it's a solid 4 songs, so I recommend it to those who like the Persona songs.",
    "I feel sorry for you",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the photo, but the actual product is a dark gray with a bluish tint.",
    "And it wasn't double-backed.",
    "So for now, she is staying put.",
    "Addendum: After posting the review, I received an email from the seller offering to exchange the item for a new one and apologizing.",
    "The subsequent processing was also quick.",
    "I think the response was very good even though it was a cheap product.",
    "4 stars for the response, I also bought gold afterwards.",
    "The color is almost exactly the same as the photo, and I think it's very beautiful.",
    "But the buckle is not double locked as shown in the description photo.",
    "That's a pity.",
    "It gets really heavy in the evening.",
    "I used it on a SIM-free iPhone7s.",
    "At first, I didn't know how to set it up after arriving in Korea and pointing the SIM card, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to teach me (set it up from settings>mobile communication>communication options and turn on data roaming).",
    "The instructions that came with the product didn't seem to be very helpful...?",
    "However, the reception in the area around Gimpo Airport is poor, so I kept 3G on.",
    "When I went out into the city, it switched to 4G.",
    "In the evening and at night, the communication sometimes became very heavy, but now I think that it may have reached the daily maximum limit of several hundred MB.",
    "I thought it would be worse",
    "I used Softbank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim-free Ymobile, and when Z4 started to have problems, I was looking for a used Xperia when I found this new phone that I could use with my old carrier.",
    "I was worried if I could use it properly since I used Mobile Suica, but there was no problem at all.",
    "It's a bit big, heavy, and silver, so it looks like an iPhone 6?",
    "It doesn't play games so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, but it feels a little faster. According to the review, the fingerprint recognition is slow, so it takes a little time to recognize it. Therefore, I use the face recognition.",
    "I thought it was like an iPhone, it's really good. I also upgraded to Android version 9, and I was able to buy it to my satisfaction.",
    "Things that bothered me: it could be a little smaller, it doesn't have a strap-hole, *It is compatible with cases that have a strap-hole. I haven't tested its water resistance. It's a little heavy. I haven't used it much yet, but I'm satisfied with it. I recommend it."
