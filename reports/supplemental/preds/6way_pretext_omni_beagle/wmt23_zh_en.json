First, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to launch export control on China\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing equipment under US pressure. Then, foreign media reported that the US government was considering cutting off all connections between US suppliers and Huawei, and prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue an administrative order to restrict US investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries.",
    "In recent years, the United States has never stopped attacking China's \"core\" development, on the one hand, accurately suppressing the supply chain of Sino-US semiconductor production, and on the other hand, building a \"de-China\" semiconductor production industry chain alliance, in order to completely \"discard\" China in the advanced semiconductor production industry.",
    "Whether it is to establish a \"technological alliance\" with South Korea to build a \"chip quadrilateral alliance\" with South Korea, Japan, and China Taiwan, or to build a \"small circle\" of the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the \"four-party mechanism\" and the \"Indo-Pacific Economic Framework\" between the United States and Japan, Australia, and India, the United States is using political, factional, and weapon",

    "After the Spring Festival, many members found that the stores they were in were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the closure of the institution caused members to panic, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.",
    "Finally, the responsible person of the institution came forward to respond and promised to make efforts to ensure the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, which helped to calm the storm.",
    "Some individual fitness centers have encountered operational problems and temporarily closed their doors. Consumers can be patient and wait for the problem to be resolved. Why do some members react with \u201csomething is wrong\u201d?",
    "Behind the member rights protection storm of the fitness club, there is a deep-seated problem of trust crisis in the industry.",
    "Traditional gyms in China usually adopt the prepaid model, and the logic of \"earning money from users who do not come\" is the bottom line of their development.",
    "By obtaining cash flow through pre-sale membership cards and opening new stores, it seems that the cycle can be repeated, but in fact, it is like eating the tiger's meat and eating the hare's meat, and it is impossible to form a stable profit model.",
    "The negative information about gyms, running and other industries is frequently released, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.",
    "From the perspective of market prospects, of course, fitness clubs can be said to be a \"money-making\" good business.",
    "The fitness competition may be up and down, but it always attracts capital attention.",
    "Multiple data show that the temperature of the cultural consumption sector continues to rise, and the market continues to warm up.",
    "Specifically, in the fitness market, as residents' living standards gradually improve, the concept of a healthy lifestyle has deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the fitness industry has great potential for development.",
    "The better the situation, the more the industry needs to focus on quality development.",
    "However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumption recovery, and they are just coming out of the crisis, blowing the horn of opening up and expanding, and pouring the funds into the construction of new stores.",
    "It cannot be denied that in recent years, the pandemic has caused many institutions to withdraw, the industry to reorganize, and powerful enterprises to selectively increase their acquisition strength and repositioning, which has brought new opportunities.",
    "However, in order for the fitness market to develop into a virtuous cycle, the industry must change its traditional model and change its business strategy.",
    "Only by firmly establishing consumer trust and security can we truly win the market and the future.",
    "Instead of seizing the market like the new store of Dabeinong, the fitness industry needs to focus on optimizing services and building a high-quality user base.",
    "First, you have to keep users by providing services.",
    "Fitness centers belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to the \"user-oriented\" principle, to closely surround the needs of users, and to put the focus of operation on the improvement of service quality.",
    "Second, we need to improve the user experience through digital transformation.",
    "For example, the current popular Internet fitness club model realizes that users pay per visit and choose the venue.",
    "At the same time, physical data and sports data can be effectively used to meet social needs and realize a complete service loop from online to offline.",
    "Without private tutoring promotion and annual membership fees, users' concerns about \"running away\" from fitness institutions are reduced, and trust is improved.",
    "In addition, we need to actively explore diversified business models.",
    "Now, sports consumption has evolved from single service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs have the potential to become a new entry point for consumption. Surrounding products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment will become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.",

    "The conditions for the \"price agreement\" are not few.",
    "The apartment building is located in Jiangbei New District and is called Boli Yucai Cloud Terrace. Mr. Sun, the prospective buyer, told the reporter that he found a \"declaration\" when he was touring the apartment building last weekend.",
    "The developer promised in the pictures he sent to the media that if the buyer bought a house in the project from February 1 to February 28, and the discount of other houses in the project was higher than the discount of the house he bought before (limited to the same type of house, the same building, the same unit, the same property type as the house he bought before), the developer would refund the difference and change the house for the buyer.",
    "Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this was a \"price agreement\", the purpose was to let the buyer feel at ease to buy, and not to worry about the developer lowering the price to promote, \"Now I am afraid that after buying it, it will be lowered, and there will be a lot of trouble at the sales office. If there is no trouble, it is indeed a good deal.\"",
    "Many buyers also believe that the \"price agreement\" is a \"pill\" for buyers, but the conditions are not low.",
    "Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house in the southern part of the Yangtze River, said that the price of the house first depends on the same type of house, and then on the same building and the same unit. Therefore, the \"threshold\" is still relatively high.",
    "Some buyers also believe that, due to information asymmetry, it is not easy for them to \"claim rights\" when selling, and there may be additional discounts.",
    "Whether the buyer can stay is worth observing",
    "According to the reporter's inquiry on the online real estate platform of Nanjing, the sale of the apartment was approved last November, with a total of 252 units, including 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, and the average price of the fully furnished apartment was 39,843 yuan/m2.",

    "Market insiders said that the \"price agreement\" had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.",
    "In August of that year, the Heshi Yellow Mountain Road project, Xihe West Garden, launched a \"Price Guarantee Plan\", which means that the company guarantees that if the discount is expanded within one year, the company will refund the difference to the original owner.",
    "In April 2011, nine property developers in Nanjing also promised to pay the difference for the apartments.",
    "\"The housing market is warming up, and now is the time to use a \"strong heart medicine\".",
    "\"Mr. Shen, a veteran operator in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the \"price agreement\" is also a marketing method for real estate companies.",
    "He believes that developers need more confidence than home buyers, and the launch of the \"price agreement\" is to boost their morale.",
    "As for whether the buyers can stay, he said that it depends on the influence of multiple factors such as control policies and loan threshold, and it needs to be observed for the time being.",

    "It is said to be leather, but it is indeed a bit hard, but if you look carefully, there are many small cracks in the local area, it is not clear whether it is real leather, and the sleeves of this garment are really incomprehensible, usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the garment, but usually only 1-2 cm, but this garment is 5 cm longer, the sleeves should naturally fall down to",
    "It's easy to buy clothes, and it's easy to return them.",
    "But when will I get my money back?",
    "The workmanship of the clothes is good, but the size is small, so I have to return it. However, after returning the goods, more than a week has passed, but I have not received the refund?",
    "And to top it off, you have to deal with the shady Peak Express, the worst customer service experience I've had buying from Amazon!",
    "But the shopkeeper is still good, actively cooperate with the courier to encourage timely refunds, but this full peak courier is really doing a lot of things that make people angry, refunds after half a month, this partner is dragging the ass of the donkey, efficiency is low, no service awareness!",
    "more suitable for young people",
    "he killed him in 99 seconds.",
    "The workmanship, color, and feel of the pants are all good, soft and not too thin or too thick, and there is no smell of oil.",
    "The pity is that the design is slim, which is more suitable for young people.",
    "I'm 179cm/80kg, waist is a bit tight in 3XL, waist is 25 inches, stretches to 40 inches, fits well.",
    "It seems that there is no belt around the waist, and it is difficult to loosen the waist.",
    "And it's uncomfortable to wear a sticker.",
    "it's okay. your complexion is not so good.",
    "I just bought it and it went up 200, what's going on.",
    "The first time Amazon used the cooperation of Tian Tian Lao Kuai, the first delivery was not at home. Later, he actively arranged two delivery times with the courier, but the courier did not deliver. Then he directly returned the goods to me. This courier has no credibility at all. I strongly recommend not to use Tian Tian Lao Kuai again.",
    "This time, they also returned a T-shirt to me, and the price of the new one was increased by more than 100 yuan.",
    "Amazon should not be selling this product",
    "I bought it when it was on sale, the price is not low, but the reviews are good.",
    "When I received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was extensively scratched, and there were scratches in other places. It was either a used product or a defective product. I will post a picture later.",
    "I applied for a return, and the manufacturer said it was caused by transportation, isn't that just a lie?",
    "How can the product be damaged inside?",
    "There are only two possibilities, either the goods are second hand or I deliberately damaged the goods and then returned them.",
    "Objectively, I don't have proof that I didn't damage the item, but based on my Amazon purchase history, I think items like this shouldn't be in Amazon's own products, customers choose Amazon because they trust them, customer win, we win, customer's win is the manufacturer's win, I hope we can all work together to improve, thank you.",
    "I've only had this product for less than a year and I have two E2s, I don't know how to handle it?",
    "I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the right receiver started to show red E2 frequently, which should be a problem with the transmitter module. This does not seem to match the statement on Amazon that the transmitter module can work continuously for 7 years. I cannot find any after-sales service on Amazon, so what should I do?",
    "i'll be fine.",
    "The first purchase is bad.",
    "It doesn't feel new.",
    "The label on the box was torn, and the label on the machine was also broken.",
    "And it always crashes.",
    "it'll be fine after the change.",
    "The replacement was quick, but the vision is a bit blurry at night, and the field of view is not wide, but it is enough for ordinary home use.",
    "The only downside is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and the other downside is that I bought a phone in Amazon before.",
    "There is a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, but there is no sticker like the one on the package this time, which can be pasted on the warranty card when buying a mobile phone.",
    "I don't know if it's because the things are cheap, but I'm confused.",
    "waiting for the supplier to reply",
    "The package has no mark, I called the supplier directly and said that the product without mark is genuine, if you have any doubts, you can send the corner of the package to Strongman Company for authentication, and leave your license plate number and phone number, and promise to send a text message to input your information into the Strongman official website warranty card, but I have not received the text message yet?",
    "I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.",
    "Second purchase.",
    "Amazon's private label business is still very comfortable.",
    "The mechanic said the oil was clean and bright, and it was indeed good oil.",
    "Because it was the second purchase.",
    "So I'm still confident.",
    "The delivery was fast, the packaging was not picky, and this oil was used, and the sound of the engine was obviously reduced.",

    "Japanese Amazon has a serious problem with customer service (8c of lice is 8cm of lice) (8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c)",
    "They admitted the mistake, but they always blamed others, and emphasized that the goods were for third parties, and they could not bind the third parties.",
    "Order Number: 503-4265464-1830254.",
    "When I bought it, the size options were 7c, 8, 9c, I thought it was a trap, so I called the DHL Chinese customer service and clearly told them that 8 was 8c, but when the goods returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm, I thought it was a trap set up to cheat Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales), now when I look at the page,",
    "Chinese customer service: I'm sorry for causing you loss. We have two ways for you to choose:",
    "1. If you return, the buyer will bear all the shipping costs.",
    "2. We will compensate you 10,000 yen if you do not return the goods.",
    "(I calculated, the shoes were 4000 yen, which is about 200 RMB, I chose 1, I don't have shoes, the loss is 200 RMB).",
    "I chose option 2, I have shoes, they compensated me 2000 yen, the loss was 150rmb, customer service: we have recorded it, we will handle it seriously, the next day we sent an email saying that I do not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and that's it.",
    "I suggest: when the purchase page is 7c, 8c, 9c, which is misleading, the Chinese customer service told me that the Japanese common code will not have c, such as 140, but have you gone to other insect pages?",
    "There are fake codes, and there are cases of mixing up the day and night codes.",
    "And again, why is the 8cm in between the 7c and 9c when it is the smallest size, what does that mean.",
    "China Customer Service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know if you want to return to your country, so we will not refund your shipping fee.",
    "I don't understand this logic, I'm Japanese, I need Chinese customer service, Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service, tourists in Japan don't have the energy to call international long distance, so the problem is, who needs to call Amazon's overseas purchase Chinese phone, it's just like me, a Japanese who is a bargain hunter.",
    "Amazon Chinese customer service is just convenient for those who are scalping.",
    "i'm not happy with this purchase.",
    "This is the second time I bought diapers from Amazon, I bought a box of diapers for my baby when he was 2 months old, and I chose European imported paper diapers, the first time I bought was more satisfying, my baby used one diaper all night, and it really can satisfy for 12 hours without changing diapers.",
    "But this time when I bought L-sized diapers, there were 2 packs in a box, and they were individually packaged. When I opened them, I found that the paper was a bit softer, and there was a clear difference from the Pampers Swaddlers. After using them on my baby, they were okay, there were no leaks or rashes.",
    "But when I used the second diaper, the baby's inner thigh immediately had red rashes, which have not gone away until now.",
    "I think there are two bags in one box, and the quality is not the same.",
    "I won't buy it anymore!",
    "we hope that the transport of packages will be protected.",
    "This is the worst packaging and shipping I have ever seen for an online purchase, with absolutely no protection measures, bubble wrap, packaging cushioning material, etc.",
    "just a compressed box.",
    "And the rubber boxed cards are all squished and deformed.",
    "I hope it's genuine, the quality is guaranteed, I'm not going to buy from Amazon anymore.",
    "I would rather be half a king in my own country than a whole king in a foreign land.",
    "And the problem of product packaging, I see that people have commented on it in 2016, and now in 2019, it's still the same.",
    "Amazon doesn\u2019t care about customer feedback at all, and is far behind domestic companies like JD.com and Tmall.",
    "it's pretty, but a little disappointing.",
    "I love the whole color of the cup, orange, even though I'm a boy's toy, I still think orange and yellow are a great combination.",
    "It's smaller than I imagined, but it's supposed to be a carry-out bag, so I can accept it.",
    "I tried it last night, when I opened the lid, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the straw is in a vertical position, so the child always has to suck the protruding part of the lid to drink water, I think this part can be improved.",
    "I think the other brands are right to make the nipples slanted, for kids stuff, safety and comfort are really important.",
    "lightweight large capacity",
    "I like it lightweight, with a big mouth, but I feel like two separate zippered compartments are a bit much for me, and I don\u2019t know what to put where.",
    "I bought it and found out that there is another brand that is very similar to it, and it only costs less than 200.",
    "counterfeit money, counterfeit specials are especially good",
    "I'm tired of Amazon selling counterfeit goods.",
    "The customer service said that I could not return it because I had used it, but I had not used it, so I did not know that it was a fake.",
    "Because of trust, I am hurt. After all, it is a cosmetic product. Why don't you go to the physical store and buy it. It is more reliable.",
    "Because it's a kill, I didn't look at the comments, I've already submitted the e-commerce platform to the State Administration for Market Regulation, let's fight together.",
    "is it broken?",
    "counterfeit?",
    "in short, it's a tragedy.",
    "The second one was very detailed but as soon as I opened it, there was a strong smell, I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before, then when I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it, it was a very strong smell, I can't describe it, I coughed immediately, my eyes hurt, I cried, I took it off and washed my face.",
    "I don't believe it, he opened another one of the same, it doesn't have that heavy taste, he's applying it now.",
    "It was like the smell of cheap hair straightener fluid.",
    "It's unimaginable. Will the self-operated skin care products of Amzon also have to avoid it?",
    "you're a crook!",
    "When I bought it, the activity page said that if you spend 99 yuan, you will get the \"Three-Body Novel\", but when I received the goods, there was no such gift. I called customer service and said that I wanted to show them the screenshot of the activity at that time. The problem is that who would save the screenshot of the website when buying something? You need customers to provide it for your own activities. Dear buyers, please keep this",
    "after feeling",
    "The first time I bought something in Amazon, I felt a few points, let's start with the feeling of using the product. First, it is really painless, and there is no stimulating taste. Overall, it is very good. It fell off after about 8 minutes. There were only a few hairs and dirt on it, which could not be seen if you did not look closely. So overall, it is good. As for the later use, I will continue",
    "I think it's pretty good.",
    "The second, I ordered on the 27th, received on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is half a month, Amazon's delivery staff service attitude is also very good.",
    "Third, don't believe the black Friday of Amazon, order on Friday, and the price will be reduced by almost 12 dollars after two days, which is about 170 dollars (including shipping and so on) that I bought, and it feels like the price is raised to promote the activity.",
    "The customer service said something about price fluctuations, but I have been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days, and the price is just like this, and the fluctuations are not big.",
    "Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with grains, absolutely repurchase!",
    "The granules in the paste give a refreshing feeling, which is very helpful, the teeth feel smooth after use, and it is much better than some second-hand products, which are said to be imported, but many products do not have Chinese labels, so it is not clear where they are sold.",
    "From now on, I won't buy second-hand clothes anymore, as long as I have Amazon.",
    "I have a suggestion for Amazon's app, sometimes the dryer doesn't dry, I hope you can improve some applications, it will be better and better!",
    "Over the years, it has been getting worse and worse, and there is no quality of service at all!",
    "Garbage Excellent does not consider customer needs. When ordering, special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.",
    "Because there is an old man who can't get out of bed easily at home, so he can only receive it at night.",
    "The result was that he came to the door at noon without any prior phone call.",
    "If you can deliver at any time your courier wants, why bother with pretending to give customers a choice of time?",
    "If you can't guarantee service, then don't do e-commerce!",

    "there's a phone number on the order!",
    "no one has called to explain anything!",
    "The so-called complaint service on the website is just a bunch of people from outside pretending to be there, flattering you and giving you a so-called answer.",
    "there will be no changes or compensation!",
    "I have encountered this kind of problem before, such as delivery time is wrong, but I have endured it. But this time, I can't endure it anymore! It's too much!",
    "The new book I bought, the cover and back cover are reversed after pre-sale, so obviously the quality problem is closed and the book is sent to customers.",
    "If you get a negative review, no one will contact you.",
    "Over the years, it has been getting worse and worse, and there is no quality of service at all!",
    "I won't spend a dime on that overrated piece of shit.",
    "the image quality is just unacceptable.",
    "As a book with the title \"Collection of Old Maps\", the selection, layout, and printing of the images is unacceptable. Some of the images are even marred with mosaics, making them unrecognizable.",
    "Even though this book is not a professional atlas, even though it is a small painting, it should be worthy of the ancestors' grand view of the ancient literature and resources left in the catalog!",
    "(And many of the images are available as clear original files from industry resources), what difference does it make to use these images to assemble a book compared to not using images?",
    "I am sorry for this therapeutic spirit.",
    "I won't comment on the writing, everyone has their own taste.",
    "Overall 2 stars.",
    "When I was in high school, I read this book just out of boredom, and I thought that I would never be addicted to such a book, because I was not attracted to the original online novels.",
    "and then... fell into the pit.",
    "As for the plot, the book is generally light and enjoyable, with the first part of the book where Lei Xue is still in the network game, even the inter-guild intrigues are usually lightened by the blood of the Lei Shen.",
    "As for the competition part, I wrote a few points of bittersweet feelings of the times, alternating between old and new (maybe I am too sensitive).",
    "I spent a lot of time studying it in high school, but I couldn't stop.",
    "The full-time description of characters and emotions is very beautiful, some characters only appear occasionally, but they will leave a deep impression on the readers, like the characters that are described in more detail, such as Y\u00e8 Xi\u00f9 H\u00f3ng Sh\u0101o D\u00e0n M\u00f9o Ch\u00e1ng, who have a lot of fans, and the characters that are not the focus of the writing, such as Ji\u0101ng B\u014d D\u00f9n Ch\u00e1ng Yu\u00e1n Xi",
    "And in terms of emotions, full-time doesn\u2019t have the usual problems of the net with the \u201cbeautiful\u201d Li Lizi, the \u201cbeautiful\u201d women, or the \u201crotten\u201d ones, all the characters\u2019 emotions have a common ground, that they like the game of glory, and most of them want to win honorably.",
    "They're small in number, but they're not plotting anything sinister. They're all so simple and sweet.",
    "Maybe that's why there's no full-time character that people hate.",
    "Full-time IP also contributed a lot.",
    "Leaving aside the phenomenon of web literature, Full-Time is a good book.",
    "He will give you some hot blood, some emotion.",
    "I'll start working on manga in April this year.",
    "I wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I didn't have enough money to buy it, so I didn't have the courage to buy it. When I wanted to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fake books on TB, and the latest version of the full-time version was released recently. The cover picture is quite good, but I still want to buy the old version first, so I went to Amazon to take a look",
    "Now, let's talk about the goods situation.",

    "\u2022 It seems that the publishing company for a few books is different, like the 23rd and 17th are the same publishing company, and different from the others.",

    "lonely little lion",
    "I thought it would be like The Lost Chapter, but the text is still a lot!",
    "I read it three times before the children finished the book, about a little lion who could shoot, and a little lion who loved to eat fruit-flavored gummy candies.",
    "When I saw the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern city people can't accept the arrangement that animals eat people.",
    "And at the end, you see this little lion who has succeeded in human society, but has lost himself, and is neither fully lion nor fully human.",
    "And then, only the back of the lion, and we don't know where he went.",
    "Maybe years from now, the image of this little lion will still be in the mind of the grown up child, and one day, unexpectedly, it will touch or inspire her.",
    "a high-quality collection",
    "1. I didn't know TASCHEN before, but I bought a lot of their books recently because they are too strong. Whether it is the selection or the production itself.",
    "The first edition was 49mm x 34mm; the second edition was the same size as the Miyazaki Collection edition of Mushishi, which is 49mm x 34mm; the third edition was about 36mm x 23mm; and the fourth edition is the smallest, and comes in a box with two books.",
    "I think it's still acceptable, first of all, the price is cheap, and 700+ pages are divided into two books, which is more convenient to read as a paperback; secondly, unlike the Michelangelo Complete Works, the paintings occupy the main body, and the black and white manuscripts occupy most of the Dante version, for budget-conscious and non-art professional readers, this version has the highest cost-benefit ratio for",
    "2. The commentary on the painting is great, with diagram analysis, draft analysis and historical background (like the last dinner), but I don't know if it's a print or a book size problem, some of the shadows are too deep, and you can't see the details, which is a pity.",
    "third , the manuscript of Dante is much richer than that of Michelangelo.",
    "The former is a genius, while the latter is too broad in his achievements and too high in his accomplishments to be described as a genius.",
    "If you only saw the paintings before, you could only feel half of Da Vinci. After seeing the manuscript, you would have no words left.",
    "garbage, who buys it and regrets it!",
    "This is a piece of trash, I wasted my money, Godma, give me a reason!",
    "1. The time is not accurate, and suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time is reset to zero.",

    "The delivery is so bad, even Amazon is slow, and it\u2019s even slower than I thought!",
    "overall, i'm satisfied.",
    "I was worried about the camera packaging at first, but this time it was fine, with a battery inside, the camera was in good condition, and it could be registered on the official website, the shutter count was 0, and the rest could only be checked after a period of time.",
    "The delivery speed is quite fast, I want to complain about the courier brother, the valuable items are put in the door room, and walk quickly, I can't open the box to check in front of him, I really have no words.",
    "The merchant thinks about the customer before shipping the goods:)",
    "The retailer was more responsible, actually, because they called me to ask about the screen size of the camera I was using.",
    "The delivery speed is also fast.",
    "The gold foil is also quite suitable and convenient to stick on.",
    "the battery is not fully charged.",
    "The machine is good, but I want to ask how come the first time I charged it, it didn't fully charge, and the charging indicator light was always red?",
    "There is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so we can only feedback through product reviews.",
    "1. On March 29th, I pre-ordered this book for $31 and it showed that it would be delivered to my device on March 31st, but at the time, Amazon's website could not preview this book (because it had not been released);",
    "2. On March 31, the book pushed to the device was blank, with only \"waiting for you\" inside, and Amazon lowered the price of the electronic version to 18 yuan;",
    "3. I've tried repeatedly over the last two days to delete the blank downloaded book from my device and resync, but I've been unable to get the e-book version of \"The Essential Drucker\" with actual content, but I see that Amazon's website is now offering a preview of the book.",
    "i have a few thoughts about it.",
    "1. Price isn't the issue, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books with real content now, instead of always downloading \"waiting for release\"",
    "2. Once you pre-order a book, you probably won't buy it again, because if you cancel, you'll have to download a book with no content, and the process is quite complicated;",
    "3. I hope Amazon has a normal channel to feedback this kind of problem when downloading e-books or using them and have a place to feedback (ticket, online customer service, etc., can refer to how Microsoft official store does it)",
    "I don't recommend reading it.",
    "I read it a long time ago, and by chance I saw some reviews written by people who read it, so I thought I'd write my own review.",
    "This is not a collection of short stories, but rather a collection of fragments of love in life.",
    "The tone of the book is very flat, like plain water, the pursuit of simplicity in expression and sentence construction is extreme, and the plot is as quiet and flat as a summer afternoon street.",
    "Each short story is a snippet of time from an ordinary life, without a beginning or an end.",
    "They were collected together in the album \"When We Talk About Love We're Talking About Nothing\".",
    "I think that the collection of stories and its title are a kind of behavioral art, which the author wants to express that love is not only the tragic love and happiness on the stage, the urban legend of the dried sea and the broken stone, nor is it only the glue-like and lacquer-like you and me, love is not only the above, nor should it be represented by the above, love is also the ordinary life, the tedious and tasteless daily",
    "Reading this book might bring to mind the quarrelling couple you sat next to on the plane, the friend of a friend whose marriage seems to have lost its spark, or the relationship that just didn't work out.",
    "That's why I don't recommend reading it, from a reviewer's perspective, the writing and plot are both bland, unless your life is a rollercoaster of drama or you live in Candyland, in which case you'll feel like you're reading something that's either not worth the time or just plain weird.",
    "And on a deeper level, the anecdotes don't illuminate or expand the characters' thoughts or perspectives (unlike in Marx's \"The Time of the Doves\"), and the brief scenes don't explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?",
    "What are the reasons for the protagonist's marital breakdown?",
    "So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't matter.",
    "The author's ideas are more often expressed through technique and form than through plot, which is why the reading experience is less satisfying.",
    "It's good for rough reading, but not for detailed reading.",
    "The logic of the book is good, but the content is not enough.",
    "They have explained a lot about what sales theory is and why, but they are weak in how to do it. They just point out the direction but do not give specific ways.",
    "Also, this book feels like it was put together.",
    "There are examples both in the country and abroad, both among well-known entrepreneurs and salesmen and among people who are not well-known.",
    "I don't know if it's a story made up to illustrate a point, but if it's a story about an author's own experience, it would be more convincing.",
    "The term for customers is constantly changing.",
    "The title is still customers, and the content is changed to customers.",
    "spelling errors, missing punctuation, and numbering errors were also found in the eBooks.",
    "In summary, this book is a good choice for a theoretical introduction, but it is not suitable for people who have been engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales level.",
    "A quick guide to internet finance",
    "This book is shallow, can be said to be a textbook, can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of Internet finance, but to understand in depth, still need to follow the picture to dig.",
    "The time when Ma Huateng wrote the book was earlier, and the supplementary content of PayPal, WeChat, and the cultivation of user habits were not mentioned later. Now, the share of third-party payment is probably not as small as what was mentioned in the book.",
    "Nowadays, many people take their mobile phones when they go out to eat, and merchants also abandon UnionPay because of high bank card turnover.",
    "But I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the history of financial development in the country and abroad, so he can write such popular and easy-to-understand content.",

    "They are all good, so I will go to the sea to pick them up.",
    "Size: I am 176cm tall and weigh 68kg. My shoulders are usually 180cm, so I bought M, the sleeves are a bit long, the rest fits perfectly. I see that there are S size recommendations, is the body so slim? Or do you prefer tight? I think the sweater is better to be a little loose.",
    "it's just right.",
    "Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84kg, consulted customer service before purchase and was told to buy xxl, then read reviews and decided to buy L, after receiving the goods, the size was just right, almost got scammed.",

    "The quality of toy processing is not good.",
    "Most of the screw holes are not aligned, and it is difficult to screw in the screws, which shows that the processing quality is not good. I don't know how long it can be played, because it is a toy promised to the child, so I won't return it.",

    "it's just a normal day.",
    "is it because i'm unlucky?",
    "The packaging is old and worn; the build quality is poor; the music is one song that is only 8 seconds long and then repeats over and over; the action is just shaking the brain bucket in a circle and walking forward, with no variation.",
    "it's not worth it.",
    "I'm in a hurry, so I won't take it back.",
    "The toy quality is good, but the packaging is bad.",
    "Yesterday I received a courier, bought by Amazon, marked as EMS delivery, and finally delivered by TNT, how many bends did it go through? Amazon and TNT have a good relationship?",
    "Again, the packaging, it's just a few layers of cling film, inside there's no packaging plastic or bubble wrap, when you open it, all the parts are just in an empty box, it's fun that the toy quality is good, there are no broken parts, but it's too small, because it's not battery powered, it's easy to fall off when you push it, the track is too wide, the design is not good.",

    "I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch has a time check when it is in stock. They replied that it does. So why is the time difference so much, which means the watch is not accurate. In simple terms, it is a product of water. It is not that I am saying it is difficult to hear. Look, it is clearly a quality problem (the digital display is not complete). Is it a garbage product.",
    "I contacted the seller, the seller gave me a bunch of reasons and blamed me for buying their stuff, this product, this seller, this customer service, who would ever buy anything on Amazon again.",

    "I used to use a piece of Xihecheng, and I felt that it would not be a few seconds different after two or three years.",
    "The calendar function is actually quite good, but the timer function is a bit useless, basically not used, and occasionally accidentally enter the timer mode.",

    "i'm very satisfied with this watch.",
    "It is definitely genuine, and I went to the specialty store to verify it. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it is equipped with imported mechanical core. Therefore, it has a certain weight, which is unmatched by the so-called mechanical watches of 300-400 yuan. This is a real thing.",

    "the worst shopping experience in history",
    "On the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone. I immediately ordered a new one from Lima, Peru for 8p, but it was not self-pickup and there was no additional charge (I was secretly happy). Since it was not self-pickup, the delivery time was slower, and the system showed that the latest delivery date was September 27.",
    "My wife doesn't have a phone and it's hard to live without one. She called me at 6:30 in the morning the next day to think of a solution. After looking at the Jingdong website, I found that there was 256GB in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.",
    "I just bought a new one, so I want to cancel the order for the Amazon right away.",
    "Because the order was placed at midnight, it was impossible to receive the delivery in the middle of the night. At 7:30 in the morning, I called the customer service to request cancellation of the order, and the customer service replied that the order had been canceled and I should wait for the SMS notification.",
    "OK, I just waited patiently, and when I checked my phone at noon, the order was still in the status of not shipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to ask them to cancel the order, and the customer service replied that they had already operated OK.",
    "At 3pm, I checked my phone and found that the order was still there. I couldn't help it and had to contact customer service again to confirm that I had called three times and asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship the item!",
    "The customer service rep contacted the seller at my request and told me the seller was unfamiliar with the system and would have to wait until he was familiar with it before he could cancel the order.",
    "But I was told that the seller already knew, so I was reassured that it would not be shipped.",
    "When I checked the orders on Monday, I found that they had already been shipped, and I was speechless.",
    "I couldn't contact the seller directly, so I had to call customer service again.",
    "The back-end processing was just unbelievable. I basically told them what to do, and they would follow my instructions.",
    "The order is still in the status of delivery refusal, and is preparing to be delivered again!",
    "won't Amazon just come after you?",
    "The seller company has already received the money, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.",
    "In summary, I will never pay in advance for big things again, it's too troublesome.",
    "it looks so beautiful.",
    "I've been interested in this camera for a long time, but because of some other reasons besides the price, I didn't buy it. This time, because of the bundle, the price is also acceptable, so I bought it.",
    "Bought it, no problem with anything else, but when I tried to connect to the software, I couldn't connect, I have a TP router at home, I searched online and found that many people have this problem, I spent more than two hours trying to change the router settings, and finally used 360WIFI as a mediator to connect to the one that worked, during which I called Xiaomi customer service, they didn't have any solutions for",
    "Another thing to note is that I saw users online commenting that the camera supports a minimum of 8G storage card, and if the storage capacity is smaller, it cannot be identified. Please note this.",
    "It is usable, the screen is acceptable, but the sound quality is very bad, the machine is a bit hot, and if you use it for a long time, the heat is a bit unacceptable.",
    "In summary, this product has many shortcomings, so please be careful when buying.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because I bought this for my first love, we were together for 3 years and then just left me last year, and I still feel it.",
    "I gave it 3 stars because I bought it for my first love, and now I don't know how much I'll use it, so maybe I'll throw it away!",
    "We were together for almost 3 years, and then she left me last year.  Now, whenever I think of her, I feel like I want to leave this world. She was the first woman in my life, and she left a shadow and pain in my life that I still haven't been able to get out of.",
    "When I bought this phone, I thought of the two feelings I had at the time, and I still wanted to share the bitterness together, but now it is a regret, maybe life is like this, some people don't want to meet in their life, some things don't want to know in their life, but what can we do?",
    "Every time I see a Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain comes flooding back, filling me up. I've never spent more than 2000 yuan on a phone, but I didn't hesitate to buy one for her. No matter how good a person is, one day they'll change their mind, and all the promises in the world will be forgotten.",

    "A company without strength can never do this, nor dare to do so!",
    "That's why I chose Huawei.",
    "I bought it half a year ago and I feel it is good, very good.",
    "I didn't give it a full 5 stars because once when using the offline navigation, it showed that I was not in the right place, but I couldn't find the reason, but other times it was very good.",
    "And it has online input of destination, search and automatically design routes, after leaving wifi, its offline navigation function is very practical, no need to run traffic, it directly communicates with satellites to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!",
    "Sony is good",
    "Sony's low-end phones still have a good design, and are cheap, with a large screen, great battery life, and are very suitable for the elderly.",
    "Although it's been a while since I've used it, it still works great.",
    "But since my Z2 is down, this phone has completed its mission."
