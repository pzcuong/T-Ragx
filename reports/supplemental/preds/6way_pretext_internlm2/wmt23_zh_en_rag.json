    "if governments respond to the current recession in the same way , interventions to prevent drug use and related risky behaviors and treatment services for substance use disorders may be severely affected .",
    "In addition, the priority of interdiction and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.",

    "Methamphetamine and other synthetic drugs are often smuggled in carry-on bags or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Because almost all commercial aviation is restricted, the supply of drugs via commercial air travel may be completely cut off.",
    "Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the activities of trafficking using the dark web and parcel post may increase.",
    "In the long run , economic recessions and related shutdown measures may disrupt drug markets .",
    "as a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunity , the poor and disadvantaged are more likely to use drugs in harmful ways , to develop drug dependence , and to turn to illicit drug activities , whether production or distribution .",

    "This to some extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the fact that the younger population in developing countries grows faster.",
    "Teenagers and young adults make up the largest percentage of drug users.",
    "Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while it declined by 10% in developed countries.",
    "1 urbanization is a current and future driver of the drug market",
    "Drug abuse is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas in both developed and developing countries.",
    "The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas \u2014 more than half of the world\u2019s population now lives in cities, compared with 34% in 1960.",
    "Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market , especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced .",
    "increases in wealth are associated with increases in drug use , but the burden of disease is greatest among the poorest people worldwide . In developed countries , drug use is more prevalent than in developing countries .",
    "Cocaine and other drugs are more closely linked to the world's wealthier regions.",
    "similarly , within countries , higher rates of drug use are associated with higher socioeconomic status .",
    "But the rate of conversion to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socioeconomic status .",
    "data from a few countries suggest that harmful patterns of drug use are associated with low income as well as illness .",
    "these patterns are less common in more affluent social strata .",
    "The economic constraints of the global Covid-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have historically been associated with increases in drug use, and this pandemic has forced millions of people around the world out of work.",
    "COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of drug markets The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, or because of the reduced control capacity of the government departments, or because in the economic crisis, more people may have to take risks to engage in illegal activities.",
    "The related restrictions on COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, and the smuggling of goods by sea may have increased as a result. The risk of interception at sea is low, and the amount of smuggling by sea is greater than that by air or land.",
    "Recently, there have been reports that cocaine shipments are being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.",
    "WE IMPROVE the ability of people to deal with complexity.",
    "The situation of non-international controlled substances is stable, but the new type of opioids with potential harm is increasing, and the drug market is becoming more and more complicated.",
    "In addition to cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added to the list, many of which are not controlled internationally. Nonmedical use of drugs is also on the rise.",
    "There are about 500 new psychoactive substances in the domestic market of member states every year.",
    "currently , most of these are stimulants , followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small number of opioids .",
    "Although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, only 2% were opioids, but this number rose to 9% by 2018.",
    "many of the novel synthetic opioids are fentanyl analogs , and their potency and harm have been demonstrated , leading to overdose deaths in North America and elsewhere , although to a lesser extent .",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs , including cocaine and methamphetamine , and as a precursor for the manufacture of illicitly produced opioid drugs .",
    "some evidence suggests that injection of new psychoactive substances is also occurring in Europe : a study of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many of the syringes contained substances that produce stimulant effects .",
    "2the use of new psychoactive substances may become firmly entrenched in disadvantaged groups",
    "single new psychoactive substance has rarely formed a large market.",
    "But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalised groups such as the homeless and prisoners.",
    "22 countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons , with synthetic cannabinoids being identified as the main challenge in most of these countries .",
    "the control of precursor chemicals forces drug manufacturers to innovate, and many of the chemicals used as precursors to synthesize amphetamine, methamphetamine and \u201cecstasy\u201d have been placed under international control.",
    "Drug traffickers and drug manufacturers have been looking for substitutes - not only less controlled substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade controls, so-called \"special precursors\".",
    "restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze the drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.",

    "Methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq grow",
    "as early as 2012 , surveys of personnel in hospitals , prisons , and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq .",
    "crystalline methamphetamine has become a major drug of concern in addition to fenethylline and tramadol .",
    "A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with users saying that cannabis is harder to get than \"cocaine\" or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the Bureau has expressed concern about the large importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors in methamphetamine processing sites.",
    "Methamphetamine production in Afghanistan appears to have started in 2014 .",
    "Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing .",
    "However, the amount of cocaine seized in the first half of 2019 - 657 kg - was a sharp increase compared with the previous year.",
    "Large quantities of crystallized methamphetamine have been seized in several countries and there has also been a significant increase in seizures of Ecstasy in the region.",
    "policy changes and trends",
    "the jurisdictions that have legalized the nonmedical use of marijuana have generally seen an increase in marijuana use",
    "Canada, Uruguay and 11 states in the U.S. allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "in most jurisdictions , cannabis use has increased since legalization , although similar trends have been observed in jurisdictions that have not legalized nonmedical use .",
    "In the two states in the US that were the first to legalize cannabis, Colorado and Washington, the number of adults who use cannabis for non-medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and those who use it daily or almost daily, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that since 2011, cannabis use in Uruguay has increased, with a near doubling of use last month.",
    "this suggests that the increase is primarily attributable to increased use of marijuana on a regular and frequent basis .",
    "Short-term data from Canada also suggests that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, so did use.",
    "However, 40% of cannabis users still obtain some products illegally in 2019.",
    "Has cannabis legalization caused a global drop in cannabis herb seizures?",
    "In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb fell to the lowest level in 20 years, owing to a reduction in the quantity seized in North America, which fell by 84% over the past decade.",
    "By contrast , the level of seizures in the rest of the world nearly doubled during the same period . The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline .",
    "the regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have had a restraining effect on the domestic market for new psychoactive substances , but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of this regulation .",
    "countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence of use of these substances .",
    "in other countries , use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation .",
    "the use of drugs for pain management and palliative care is available in high @-@ income countries but is not available in low @-@ and middle @-@ income countries , and the distribution of these drugs is uneven across regions .",
    "In 2018, more than 90% of the drug\u2010class opioids available for medical use were in high\u2010income countries.",
    "about 50% in North America , 40% in Europe , and 2% in Oceania .",
    "These countries account for about 12% of the world's population .",
    "It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but the consumption of opioid drugs is less than 10%.",
    "obstacles to obtaining prescription opioids are associated with many factors , including legislation , culture , health care systems , and prescribing practices .",
    "People who are poorer are more likely to have a substance use disorder. In 2018, an estimated 3.56 million people had a substance use disorder.",
    "Poverty , limited education , and social marginalization may increase risk for substance use disorders and exacerbate their consequences . This has been demonstrated in high @-@ income countries , where adverse socioeconomic trajectories , not just a person 's status at a given point in time , are associated with risk for substance use disorders .",
    "drug use disorders also deepen social and economic disadvantage , further increasing the risk of unemployment , poverty , and homelessness , thereby perpetuating the cycle of disadvantage . These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system .",
    "women , ethnic minorities , immigrants , sexual and gender minorities , people displaced by armed conflict or disaster , and people in rural settings may be disproportionately affected by substance use disorders or have difficulties accessing treatment services .",
    "according to the disability @-@ adjusted life @-@ year ( DALY ) metric , which estimates the number of healthy life @-@ years lost because of disability and premature death , harmful drug use has had a greater social impact in the past decade .",
    "between 2007 and 2018 , the global burden of disability @-@ adjusted life @-@ years attributable to drug use increased by 17 % .",
    "the increase in years of life lost to liver cancer associated with untreated hepatitis C among people who inject drugs is particularly high , at 40 % .",
    "the links between drug use and violence are complex and difficult to determine the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence .",
    "limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide .",
    "but alcohol seems to have a bigger effect in violent incidents than drugs do .",
    "although drug use may lead to crime , in some cases , this association can be partially attributed to multiple intervening factors , such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity that are caused by individual risk , family environment , and peer influences .",
    "The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, including large-scale organized crime activities such as international drug trafficking, it is possible to carry out these activities without violence.",
    "In the short term , the presence and extent of violence are more a function of changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized crime groups than of the amount of trafficking . These changes include the size of the illegal market , the death or incarceration of prominent criminals , and law enforcement actions that weaken one group relative to another .",
    "View the latest trends",
    "Drug use most commonly involves cannabis, opioids cause most harm",
    "However, the most widely used drug globally continues to be cannabis, with an estimated 188 million people having used the drug in 2017.",
    "By comparison , 58 million people used opioids in 2018 .",
    "But the harms associated with opioids have been largely ignored because of their relatively small user base.",
    "of the estimated 167,000 deaths in 2017 that were associated with drug use disorders , 66 % were attributable to these substances , and 50 % of the 21 million years of life lost to disability or premature death that were attributable to drug use were attributable to these substances .",
    "the nonmedical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated a public health crisis",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by tramadol ; in North America, it is fentanyl . These two regions have little in common in terms of economic, demographic or general patterns of drug use , but both are struggling with an opioid crisis fueled by substances that are readily available and cheap to produce .",
    "In North America, the use of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids has led to a 20 @-@ year increase in opioid overdose deaths .",
    "of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States in 2018 , two thirds involved fentanyl .",
    "Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.",
    "part of the reason fentanyl is involved in overdose deaths is that the potency of fentanyl in the illicit drug market is unpredictable .",
    "the market for nonmedical use of tramadol has grown substantially in West Africa , Central Africa , and North Africa .",
    "In that region, the number of patients treated with tramadol for the condition is increasing.",
    "In 2017, the global seizure of tramadol increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "But in 2018, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.",
    "The two regions are driven by the ease of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogs and precursors.",
    "The worsening of these two crises is due to the availability of these substances in both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making them more difficult to detect and prevent from abuse .",
    "Increasing use of stimulants",
    "The stimulant field is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their main markets.",
    "In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, because it is popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "Approximately 27 million people used amphetamines that year, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine type in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "Based on the majority of indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has expanded over the past 20 years.",
    "in some markets , cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist , sometimes as substitutes , and the use of one drug rises as the use of the other falls , or both rise and fall to meet the same demand .",
    "COVID @-@ 19 increases risk for injection drug users",
    "An estimated 11.3 million people inject drugs in 2018, and globally, 10% of all HIV infections are caused by injection drug use.",
    "More than 1 million people who inject drugs have HIV and 5.5 million have Hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, while most of the hepatitis C among injecting drug users remained untreated.",
    "the opioid shortage caused by COVID @-@ 19 restrictions may lead users to substitute more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs .",
    "as some users switch to injecting or more frequent injecting , there may be more harmful use patterns .",

    "The move is a response to the growing problem of illegal immigration in Europe, where the core issue is that very few illegal immigrants are ever deported.",
    "According to the summit document, the EU leaders called on the Commission to \"immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds\" to strengthen the external border with infrastructure and surveillance.",
    "However, the EU and its member states have been arguing over who should pay for the fences.",
    "Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not pay for the costs.",
    "But some diplomatic officials of the member states said that if the EU can share the part of the installation of cameras, observation towers and other facilities along the external border, it will save the national budget and speed up the construction process.",
    "The Euractiv website said that EU officials admitted that there were bottlenecks in every step of the refugee reception process, and that the limited reception capacity and the overwhelmed immigration authorities of member states could not stop refugees from submitting \"countless\" asylum applications in all EU countries, and the EU's refugee reception system was in a state of \"near permanent crisis\".",

A residential complex in the Jiangbei New District claims to \"compensate the difference in price\" and offers more benefits than the previous discount for other sources of housing before the delivery. The developer is willing to exchange",
    "The \"price guarantee\" conditions are not a few",
    "The name of this residential complex located in the Jiangbei New District is Poly Yanziju Yunyuntai. Mr. Sun, a prospective buyer, told the reporter that he found a \"notice\" while browsing the complex last weekend.",

The number of non-farm jobs increased by 517,000, which was much higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, which was the lowest in nearly 50 years; the year-on-year growth rate of hourly wages was 4.4%, and the month-on-month growth rate was 0.3%, which",

The non-agricultural employment may not be as strong as",
    "From the structure, the impact of high-tech enterprises layoffs still exists, but the proportion is low; the new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels and education and health care has risen sharply, and the data shows that the labor force shortage still exists in the service industry.",
    "The rise of the service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor shortage data, as well as the strong consumption credit data, which are all far beyond expectations, indicates that the US service industry has experienced a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.",
    "We believe that the supply and demand tension in the US labor market cannot be improved without recession.",
    "The U.S. labor market still has a supply gap of more than 5 million, while the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old has approached the peak before the epidemic.",
    "In addition, due to the strong excess savings and consumer credit of American residents, the strong demand for consumption will further delay the impact of tightening policy on the employment market.",
    "The tight supply and demand in the US labor market will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.",
    "Adding to the fact that the interest rate hike is about to end, and the inflation expectation keeps fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline of wage growth.",
    "Before the release of this data, the U.S. stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the path of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.",

The adjustment of extreme expectations and trading congestion may cause some damage to the market.",
    "However, the stubbornness of wage growth will not change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, and with the M2 data turning negative and the leading indicators of various CPI items gradually improving, the U.S. CPI data has turned to a rapid decline phase since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data, and the current market expectations are difficult to disprove, and the market may enter a new round of bargaining after the next inflation data",

    "and what a twist(ed) ending!",
    "The US military shot down an unidentified object flying in the sky of Alaska with the most advanced stealth jet fighter F-22 on Friday afternoon (February 10).",
    "The crash site is about 10 miles off the coast of Alaska.",
    "This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an airborne object.",
    "A Chinese spy balloon that had been drifting over the United States for days was shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday.",
    "The second object was first detected in U.S. airspace on Thursday night as it moved over northeastern Alaska, at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), and was about the size of a small car, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier, the Pentagon said.",
    "The Pentagon also said there was no indication that the object was maneuverable.",
    "John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the exact nature of the object is unclear, it \"poses a reasonable threat to the safety of commercial aircraft.\"",
    "Kobe said that this object was different from the espionage balloon found in the United States, and it did not hang \"effective load\".",
    "\"We call it a 'body' because that's the best description we can give it right now,\" Kobe said.",
    "President Biden made the decision to shoot down the object after consulting with the Pentagon, and he did so \"very carefully,\" Koby said.",
    "The official description of this object by the US government is: it is about the size of a small car, without a control rod, without a suspension device, and flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.",
    "But this information does not answer the basic questions, such as what this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is on.",
    "At present, many analyses and speculations on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.",
    "It may be like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, both of which were on a mission somewhere.",
    "Some people also associate the object in Alaska with UFO.",
    "\u201cI wish this \u2018UFO\u2019 was a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO,\u201d said Peter Meijer, a former U.S. congressman, in a tweet on Friday, according to a report by Newsweek.",
    "\"It's a very amusing irony that you can mix up alien spacecraft with weather balloons, but it's not worth starting an interstellar war over,\" Maje says.",
    "Majors tweeted this shortly after it was confirmed that the object in Alaska was shot down by the US military.",
    "Newsweek said that Majer was not the only one who doubted that the object was a UFO.",
    "Republican Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month, and demanded that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) release reports on \"unidentified flying objects\".",
    "I can't believe Amazon's customer service attitude",
    "I think few people will see this, but I want to say something anyway.",
    "This dress was bought as a zip-up hoodie, but it was sent as a short-sleeved dress.",
    "After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted the customer service of Amazon. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes still had inventory. I asked for an exchange. The customer service said to solve it. Then I saw the name of the product immediately changed to short sleeves. It turned out that the link I bought was taken down.",
    "Then the customer service told me to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.",
    "This is typical of the way Amazon has handled this situation,\" he said.",
    "It's really unbelievable, the clothes sent to me are not mine, as a consumer, I require to get the goods I should get, I didn't ask for anything exaggerated, but Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.",
    "It was the first one I've caught, hopefully won't be the last.",
    "i can't understand the sleeves",
    "It is said to be made of cowhide, but it is really hard. If you look carefully, there are many small cracks in some parts. It is not clear whether it is made of cowhide. In addition, the sleeves of this suit are really incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the hem. However, it is usually only 1-2 centimeters. This suit is 5 centimeters longer. The sleeves of this suit cover the fingers when",
    "It is easy to buy clothes and return them.",
    "but I don't know when I can get my money back.",
    "The clothes are well made, but the size is too small, so I have to return them. But after a week, I still haven't received the refund?",
    "And you have to contact the seller yourself, who is not very reliable, this is the worst shopping experience since I bought Amazon products!",
    "But the store is still good. It actively cooperates with the courier to refund in time. But the whole Fengkuai Express is really doing a job that is quite angry. It takes about half a month to refund. This partner is dragging Amazon's leg. It is inefficient in work and has no service consciousness!",
    "What cities are the best for a child that young?",
    "99 seconds to kill.",
    "The workmanship, color and texture of the trousers are good, the softness and thickness are moderate, and there is no kerosene smell.",
    "Unfortunately, the fit is slim, so it is more suitable for young people.",
    "3XL, flat waist 2.5 feet, maximum stretch size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg wearing waist is a bit tight.",
    "It seems that there is no elastic at the waist, and it is difficult to add a waistband.",
    "Also, it's uncomfortable to wear it close to your skin.",
    "very good. the colors are not too bright.",
    "I just bought it and it went up by more than 200, what's going on.",
    "I used the first time to send Amazon, and the first time I didn't come home. Later, I actively made an appointment with the courier twice. The courier didn't send it. Later, he directly returned it to me. This courier has no honesty at all. I strongly suggest that you don't use the \"everyday rotten courier\" again.",
    "This time, I also returned a t-shirt, and when I re-ordered, the price had risen by more than RMB100.",
    "Amazon's own products should not have such items",
    "Buy the product when it is on sale, the price is not low, and the reviews are also very good.",
    "I was shocked when I received the product. The surface of the product was heavily worn, and there were many other places that were worn. It was either a defective product or a used product. I will upload the picture later.",
    "I applied for a refund, and the factory people said it was caused by transportation when they saw the picture. Isn't that nonsense?",
    "How can the inside of a product be worn out?",
    "There are only two possibilities, either it's a defective or used item, or I deliberately damaged the item and then returned it for a refund.",
    "Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I have not damaged the goods, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's own goods, and customers choose Amazon's own goods because they trust it, customer win, we win, the victory of customers is the victory of manufacturers, and I hope everyone can work together to improve, thank you.",
    "I have used this product for less than a year, and two E2s have appeared. I don't know how to deal with it?",
    "I bought this item on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the red E2 appeared on the right side of the receiver twice, which is probably a problem with the transmitter module. This is not consistent with the transmitter module that can work for 7 years as described on the Amazon website. I can't find any after-sales service on the Amazon website. I don't know what to do now?",
    "is it well organized?) 3.",
    "First purchase is bad.",
    "It doesn't feel new.",
    "The labels on the boxes were torn off, and the labels on the aircraft were broken.",
    "and it's always a blank screen.",
    "I was until I changed jobs and cities.",
    "The exchange was fast, but it was a bit blurry at night, and the field of view was not very wide, but it was enough for ordinary home use.",
    "The only problem is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I also bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.",
    "The packaging has a sticker to prevent the packaging from being opened, but this time there is no sticker. When buying a mobile phone, there is a sticker similar to the sticker on the warranty card, which can be pasted on the warranty card. This time there is no sticker.",
    "I wonder if it's because the things are cheap, so there's nothing to be puzzled about.",
    "waiting for the supplier's reply",
    "The package has no mark, so I called the supplier and said that the product without mark is genuine. If you have any doubt, you can send the leftover material to Johnson & Johnson for verification. I also left my license plate number and phone number. I promised to send a text message to input my information into the Johnson & Johnson official website. I haven't received the text message yet?",
    "I spent this morning getting it installed.",
    "AM: Second edition, OK.",
    "Then maybe Amazon will be a little worried.",
    "The mechanic who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and bright, so it was a good oil.",
    "This is the second time they've been bought.",
    "so we were pretty reassured by this.",
    "Express delivery, packaging has no fault, used this oil, engine sound is obviously reduced.",
    "The price/performance ratio is good, and it's hard to find synthetic oil for less than $200.",
    "Supporting star crown, supporting win card, effective protection for cars.",
    "The Japanese Amazon caused the buyer's interest to be severely damaged due to the customer service problem (the caterpillar of 8c was sent as the caterpillar of 8cm) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)",

    "Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.",
    "I originally purchased the page size option of 7c, 8, 9c, and at the time I thought this was a trap, so I called the Chinese customer service of Rakuten, and clearly stated that 8 is 8c, but when the goods returned to China, I found that only 8cm was available, and I felt that this was a deliberate trap to deceive Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), and now when I",
    "Chinese customer service: I'm sorry to have caused you loss. We have two options for you:",
    "1,You return the goods, the buyer bears all the shipping costs.",
    "If you don't return it, we'll give you 1000 yen as compensation.",
    "( I calculate the account, the shoes 4000 plus yen, as 200rmb, choose 1, I have no shoes, loss is 200 yuan.",
    "I chose option 2, and they refunded me 2000 yen in the end. I lost 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded your complaint and will handle it seriously. The next day, they sent me an email saying that they would not accept the mediation of the Chinese customer service, and that was the end of it.",
    "I suggest that when you buy the page of 7c, 8, 9c, which is confusing, the Chinese customer service will tell you that the Japanese common code will not have c, such as 140, but have you gone to other caterpillar pages to look?",
    "There are also cases of mixed tags of Japanese and English.",
    "What does 9/8c mean?",
    "Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know you want to send it back to China, so we won't reimburse your shipping fee.",
    "I don't understand this logic. I'm Japanese, I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists going to Japan don't have the time to make international long-distance calls. So the question is, who needs to make a Chinese call to Amazon overseas? It's just people like me who do day shopping.",
    "But Amazon's Chinese customer service is just convenient for those who shop abroad, right?",
    "I'm not very satisfied with this purchase",
    "This is the second time to buy Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers when my baby was two months old. I chose European imported diapers. The first purchase experience was still satisfactory. The baby used one diaper all night. It could really meet the needs of not changing diapers for 12 hours.",
    "But this time, I bought L size diapers, and there were 2 packs in each box, and the paper felt loose after opening, which was obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for my baby, it was okay, and there were no signs of urine leakage or red rash.",
    "But when the second package of diapers was used, the baby\u2019s inner thighs turned red immediately after use, and the rash has not gone away yet.",
    "I doubt the quality of the 2 packs in the box.",
    "I won't buy it again in the future!",
    "I hope that the protection of package transportation is given more attention.",
    "This is the worst package I have received from online shopping for so long. There is no protection, no cushioning foam, no cushioning layer material, nothing.",
    "It's just a box that compresses deformed things.",
    "And the soft plastic box inside is packaged, the card box is pressed open and deformed.",
    "I hope it works out. Quality is guaranteed. I'm not sure if I dare to buy things on Amazon in the future.",
    "I prefer buying my own food and cooking it myself.",
    "And the packaging problem of the product, I saw the comments in 2016, and now in 2019, it is still the same.",
    "It shows that Amazon does not care about customer feedback, and is far behind JD and Tmall.",
    "Well, only a little bit sorry!",
    "I really like the color of the whole cup, orange red, although my family is a boy, but still feel that orange red and yellow color is very bright.",
    "It's smaller than I expected, but it's meant to be taken out of the house, so it's okay.",
    "I took it home last night to try it out. After pushing the bottle cap open, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the straw was in a vertical position, my son always had to suck the protrusion on the cap to drink, so I thought that this could be improved.",
    "It seems that other brands of straw cups are right to make the straw slant, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.",
    "lightweight and large capacity",
    "I like it because it is light and has a big opening, but the two independent compartments are a bit too much for me, and I don't know what to put in them.",
    "After buying it, I found another similar one on Meiya overseas, which was only about RMB200.",
    "fake goods, fake things are especially dangerous",
    "Amazon sells fake goods, I'm really surprised.",
    "The customer service said that because it was used, it could not be returned. I didn't use it, so how do I know it's a fake?",
    "Because of trust, so sad, after all, is the face of the product, really go to the physical store to buy, approval is a little more expensive.",
    "Because it was a kill, I didn't look at the comments, I have already submitted the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Market Regulation, let's fight together.",
    "what's wrong?",
    "what is a counterfeit?",
    "Because Aaron\u2019s story is tragic.",
    "I used the second sheet and it was very fine, but when I opened it, it had a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used it before. When I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it. It was a very strong smell that I couldn't describe. It made me cough and my eyes hurt. I cried and took it off immediately.",
    "I don't believe in evil, and I opened another one that is similar, it doesn't have such a strong smell, I am currently applying it.",
    "It smells a little like the cheap hair spray they use in hair salons.",
    "I can't imagine that Amazon's own-brand cosmetics will be avoided from now on?",
    "treason makes a traitor!",
    "When I bought it, the activity page said that if you spend \u00a599, you will get a gift of \"Three-Body Full Collection\". When I received the goods, there was no gift. I called the customer service and said that I needed to show them the screenshot of the activity at that time. The problem is that who buys things and saves the screenshot of the web page? You do your own activities, and you need customers to help you? All buyers should be careful next time",
    "after use, it feels",
    "First time to buy something on Amazon, I have several feelings, I will talk about the feelings after using the product first, the first thing is that it is really painless, and there is no irritating smell, overall it is very good, it will fall off after rubbing for about 8 minutes, but there will be a small amount of hair debris on it, it is not easy to see, so overall it is good, as for whether to use it once and continue to observe,",
    "I think this thing is really good.",
    "I ordered on the 27th and received the package on the 12th, which is 15 days or half a month. The delivery service and attitude of Amazon are also good.",
    "Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. I ordered on Friday and waited for two days to get a discount of about 12 yuan. That is, I paid 170 yuan (including shipping fees and so on). It feels like they are raising the price when they have a promotion.",
    "Customer service said what price volatility, I have been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days, the volatility is not big.",
    "Price is very reasonable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with particles, and absolutely refundable!",
    "The body of the toothpaste is grainy, and the feeling of coolness is just right. After use, the teeth feel smooth. It is much better than the second-hand products. It is said to be imported products, but many products do not have Chinese labels. I don't know where they are distributed.",
    "I will not shop at amazon in the future.",
    "I have also been working on my Amazon Stores.",
    "Zhuoyue these years, getting worse, there is no service quality!",
    "Garbage Excel doesn't care about customer needs. When you place an order, they will deliver between 19:00-22:00.",
    "Because there are elderly people who are not convenient to lie down after surgery at home, so only at night can they receive conveniently.",
    "The result is that it was delivered directly at 12 noon without prior notice.",
    "If the delivery time is up to the courier to decide, why do you pretend to give customers a choice of time?",

    "The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Even if some characters are only mentioned occasionally, they will leave a deep impression on people. For example, the characters such as Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian and Su Mu Orange, who are described in detail, have a large number of fans. However, the characters such as Jiang Bota and Chu Yunxiu, who are not the focus of the writing, are also very popular. In an electronic sports novel, it",

    "I think it is acceptable. First, it is cheap, and the 700 pages are divided into two volumes, which is convenient for reading as a paperback book; second, it is different from the Michelangelo Collection, in which paintings are the main body, and this book is mostly black and white manuscripts, which is suitable for readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, as this edition is the most cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.",
    "The explanation of the painting is great, including the analysis of composition, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know whether it is printing or book size problem, some shadows are too deep, and the details are not clear, which is a pity.",

    "I was worried about the packaging of the camera at the beginning, but this time it was okay. There was an airbag inside, and the serial number of the camera was consistent. I could also register on the official website. The shutter count was 0, and the rest could only be checked with time.",
    "Shipping speed is pretty fast, but I have to complain about the courier. He put the valuable items in the door room and left quickly. I couldn't open the box in front of him to check the items. I'm really speechless about this.",
    "Merchants did think about the customer before shipping the goods:",
    "The seller is more responsible. He specially called to ask the size of the screen of the camera. He really thought of the customer.",
    "The speed is too fast; 4.",
    "The gold foil patch is also suitable and effective.",
    "the battery is not fully charged",
    "The machine is really good. I wonder why it can't be fully charged when it is charged for the first time. The charging indicator light is always red.",
    "I can't find the official feedback channel of Amazon, so I can only feedback in the product review.",
    "On March 29, I purchased this book for RMB 31 through the pre-order route, and it was scheduled to be pushed to my device on March 31. At that time, the official Amazon website still could not preview the book (because it had not been released yet);",
    "On March 31, the book pushed to the device was blank, only with the words \u201cplease wait\u201d, and the e-book version of the book was discounted to RMB 18 on Amazon.",
    "I tried to delete the blank book downloaded from the device and synchronize it again for several days, but I failed to get the electronic version of the book \"The Nature of Business\" with real content. However, I found that the Amazon official website could preview the book.",
    "i have a few thoughts",
    "The price is not the most important thing. The key is how to change the blank books on Kindle to the books with real content, not always downloading \"please wait for it\".",
    "I won't buy the book I pre-ordered again. If it fails to be delivered, I have to download another book with empty content. It's too complicated.",
    "3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal feedback channel for this kind of problem. When there are doubts about the download of e-books or use, there is a place to feedback (ticket, online customer service can be, can refer to how Microsoft official store is done)",
    "I don't recommend reading it",
    "I read it not too long ago and reviewed it.",
    "In fact, The Locum Life is his fourth book.",
    "The tone of this book is extremely plain, like plain water, and the words and sentences are extremely simple, and the plot is like a street in the afternoon in summer, quiet and plain.",
    "Each has a start, a middle and an end, albeit never final.",
    "Finally, they are gathered together and named \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\".",
    "I think this novel collection and its title are like performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the ups and downs on the stage, the legends of the city, nor the sticky sweet love between you and me. Love is not represented by the above, nor should it be represented by the above. Love is also the life of water, the dull day after day, the helplessness of life, the escape from reality, and the confusion of the future.",
    "As you read this book, you may be thinking of the couples you know who are fighting, the marriages of people you know that are dull and unfulfilling, and the relationships that are not going well.",
    "This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot are both dull, unless your life is full of drama or sweet as living in a candy castle, otherwise you will feel bored and indifferent when reading it.",
    "And from a philosophical standpoint, the daily events don't offer any new insights or expand one's thoughts and horizons (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief scenes don't explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?",
    "Reason for marriage breakdown",
    "So I don't recommend reading this book, whether you read it or not doesn't matter much.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through techniques and genres than through plot, which is why the reading experience is not so good.",
    "It is suitable for rough reading, but cannot be read in detail.",
    "The logic of the book is good, but the content is not enough.",
    "It explains a lot of sales theory, what it is and why, but it's very weak on how to do it, just pointing to the direction but not giving specific methods.",
    "It felt like separate divided pieces, rather than a whole.",
    "They come from the earth and, unlike canvas and oil, they give grudgingly.",
    "It is not clear whether the stories are made up to illustrate the point, but if the author could give some examples of his own experience, it would be more convincing.",
    "In the name of customers or customers, it is always changing.",
    "The title is still customers, but the text becomes customers.",
    "There are also problems such as typos, missing punctuation marks and wrong numbering in e-books.",
    "In short, this book is a good choice for those who want to learn the theory of sales, but it is not suitable for those who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales skills.",
    "A quick guide to internet finance",
    "This book is shallow, and can be said to be only an introductory course, which can help everyone quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand it deeply, you still have to follow the clues and dig it yourself.",
    "Moreover, the book was published at an early time, and the content of the Alipay WeChat loan subsidy war that cultivates user habits has not been mentioned yet. Nowadays, the proportion of third-party payment is probably not as small as that mentioned in the book.",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat with their mobile phones. Merchants also give up the UnionPay card because of the high bank flow.",
    "But I am still grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is obvious that the author has at least several years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the financial development history of both domestic and foreign countries. Therefore, he can write such easy-to-understand contents.",
    "It is easy to write high and empty, but it is difficult to write in plain language.",
    "I appreciate you, and I want you to know it!",
    "The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether he or she is respected and appreciated in the workplace.",
    "According to Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy, humans are innately selfish and need to fulfill their basic needs.",
    "Indeed, for the Chinese, most of them are \u201cI love you but I can\u2019t say it\u201d. Even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will keep it in their hearts and never say it out.",
    "The five languages of appreciation in this book are: words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch.",
    "I think it's not important that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them to appreciate and thank the people around you, whether they are your family, friends or colleagues.",
    "Actually, the closer the relationship, the more appreciation and gratitude is needed. Only in this way can our lives become more beautiful.",
    "If companies learn to appreciate their employees, they can retain talent to some extent and reduce the resignation rate.",
    "I would like to thank the translators for bringing us the wonderful ideas and the world from abroad.",
    "Due to the cultural background of the East and the West, there will be some differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the original version of the author, you will gain more.",
    "I would like to thank the authors, translators and editors for their hard work!",
    "I suspect this is a counterfeit product. Please have Amazon review it strictly.",
    "Quality is super bad, packaging is loose, no weight, even worse than the products on the roadside stalls, no weight, no barcode, even the packaging of ten bags is loose, which is not the characteristics of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience of Amazon, and I have applied for a refund; it is completely a quality problem; I suggest that the merchant should open his eyes and refuse the inferior goods; supplement: I bought Xinxiangyun again, 23",
    "I expect Amazon to be more careful and strict in the source of goods.",
    "The product is mediocre, and it doesn't meet expectations",
    "Another benefit: No benefits!",
    "There are many great brands selling great looking clothes for cheap.",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are still okay to use, but they are not as good as I expected.",
    "without having the weaknesses:",
    "1. There is no charging indicator light. This is the most basic power indicator light, which is saved. It is estimated that customers who purchase 300 yuan products are also given by Panasonic. There is no respect.",
    "It has a strong smell. Even if you charge it for just 10 minutes, you can smell the plastic burning.",
    "I tried it in the office for one day, and the whole room smelled like plastic.",
    "Compared with the same price range Philips PHILIPS I used before, although it has an extra blade, the quality of this product from Panasonic is really not up to the mark for consumers.",
    "Foodstuff vacuum packaging machine",
    "I received the express and saw that it was the e-commerce version. It was smaller than the one I bought at the supermarket. It should be M. It was not the same as the picture on the product description. It was the new version.",
    "I got three stars because I didn't pay attention to the product specifications. I don't mind if you sell the M size e-commerce version, but what does it mean to sell the wrong version?",
    "The e-commerce is a deep pit. It is better to go to the supermarket.",
    "That's it.",
    "i don't like the taste",
    "The child doesn't like the taste of toothpaste, and always says it's spicy. Perhaps it's more appropriate to use another word to describe it, but the child's vocabulary is currently limited to this word.",
    "I bought it during the promotion, so it was very cheap, so I didn't want to give it a bad review, so I gave it four stars, but I won't buy it again.",
    "it's the real thing. the packaging is good.",
    "The packaging is very complete, and there is an inflatable bag inside. There is no product like the one described in the online comments.",
    "The bottle was packaged with a plastic film as described in the picture, and the express delivery was very fast, and it arrived the next day after I took the picture.",
    "It's a genuine product, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be back in stock.",
    "A frustrating shopping experience",
    "I ordered something on Black Friday, but I didn't receive it for a long time. After checking, I found that the package had been signed. I asked my colleagues, but they said they didn't sign it. I contacted the express company, but they said that the sender could initiate the inquiry. I contacted the Amazon customer service, and it took more than ten days to finally figure out that the express was mistakenly delivered to someone else. It took several rounds to finally get the express.",
    "wrong picture",
    "I thought I could get the headset like Figure 1, but I got the headset like Figure 2. The figure and the headset are inconsistent. What does it mean that the headset has different sound volume on the left and right?",
    "Although the names are the same, I hope you can be careful and pay attention to it. Also, please ask the Amazon responsible person to change the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.",
    "the operating system is just so-so",
    "After so long, though, it seemed silly to not see it through.",
    "I read the comments and said that it was a very humanized design. I didn't find where it was humanized. The location of the design of the commonly used up and down, left and right, and return keys of the remote control is really not worth mentioning.",
    "So, just pretend to be a TV, and use a TV box and so on.",
    "the price is too low.",
    "The price is too low, 100 plus now 99!",
    "I have a lot of unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I just copy and paste the same review for all of them.",
    "If I evaluate this with this sentence, I can say that this product is at least 85 points above.",
    "And for the products that are not so good, I will never copy and paste the reviews. This is because other consumers will refer to my reviews when they are purchasing the products, and the merchants will also improve the quality of their products as a result.",
    "Low price good line, not fever just this is enough!",
    "This line is so cheap, but it should have reached the HDMI certification standard. It is a second kill for the domestic Akihabara products (the price is twice as high). The line is thick and flexible. There are no noise points in the 7-meter transmission. In the future, low-price lines should be recognized by Belstar!",
    "The things are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites",
    "I ordered the wrong thing, but I can't cancel the order. I tried to contact the online customer service, but the link is always broken, and I can't contact them.",
    "The delivery man called me after the goods arrived, I said I didn't want it and wanted to cancel the order, but I failed to cancel it, so the delivery man took it back and said he would sign it for me and let me apply for a refund.",
    "When I applied for a return, I was told that food items cannot be returned once they have been signed for. I tried to call Amazon customer service, but they said the same thing: once signed for, food items cannot be returned.",
    "I have bought items that cannot be returned in JD.com and Suning, including milk, diapers, etc. I contacted the customer service and they returned them. Even if the diapers were opened and the smell was too strong, I contacted the customer service and they returned them. But you can't do it in Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, but people are alive. Contact your customer service to see how to handle it.",
    "I told him that I would either take it myself or have the delivery man buy it himself. The delivery man is not easy to begin with, so why should I make him pay for something that is not his own purchase?",
    "well, i won't back down. i'll take it, but i have to give you a 1-star rating for your service.",
    "please, lay no bets.",
    "First of all, I bought it with great expectations. I thought that the brand of Dole should not be bad. After receiving it, I thought it was okay. The size was not bad. But there was a box that was mostly soft. It was not visible from the outside. It was tasteless. It was tasteless. The flesh was dark yellow. It was bad. It was sold with good and bad. Only about one third could be eaten. I advised everyone not to buy",
    "I learned my lesson, I won't buy fruits from online shopping anymore!",
    "Where is the product anti-counterfeiting mark",
    "The corner of the bottle is sunken, which should be caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, it feels that the degree of trampling is heart-wrenching. After all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it is still an international purchase. There is no obvious anti-counterfeiting mark. It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that the honey inside the bottle directly comes out from the inside. There is almost no adhesion.",
    "I don't understand why the Chinese people are so angry.",
    "these are genuine, right?",
    "Did a child take this photo and then post it?",
    "Communication facilities need to improve",
    "I bought a total of 5 pick-up coupons. When I picked them up, I reserved 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent to me. After contacting them, I confirmed that they were lost and promised to resend them. The second time I reserved, it happened to be a holiday, and the website and WeChat did not remind me that I needed to reserve on a working day, which caused unnecessary panic. I suggest that they improve this in the future.<",
    "\"Very good shopping experience.",
    "Good things are good!",
    "I still believe in Amazon's own products. Now that I buy things overseas, it's very convenient. The logistics time from overseas to China is only a few days more than that in China. I must say that Amazon's ability to clear customs in China is still very strong. It's much faster than that of the transportation. So now I buy many things on the overseas purchase.",
    "I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are produced domestically, but they are cheaper when I go abroad.",
    "Rubbish, waste, garbage ...",
    "Seeing such a package, ask everyone: do you feel that it is garbage on the roadside?",
    "A plastic fragile package, just sent from Germany in a plastic bag, is this responsible?",
    "I think this packaging is like garbage, the product is over packaged, there is no measure to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag, when I received it, the package was completely deformed, and the items inside were damaged.",
    "If I just meet one like this, I will accept it, and buy several like this, find Amazon customer service, and the customer service will say that it can be returned, but the shipping cost will be paid, and then the shipping cost will be returned to me in the form of gift card.",
    "I asked, I pay the shipping fee with cash, you give me the gift card, do you want me to buy your gift card directly? I have to send the product to the German warehouse by myself, this is not a product suffering!",
    "And I always tell the customer service that who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say that it is their responsibility, and they do not even dare to take responsibility, so what kind of after-sales service is there? In a word: accept it! But I estimate that my evaluation will not be given the opportunity to be published by Amazon, and it will be deleted directly!",
    "The quality is good, 5 stars, but the logistics is very bad",
    "Girl #1 said that everything was fine and just the check, please.",
    "2. It is solid, the material is sufficient, the welding point is firm, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is good.",
    "3. Logistics is a weakness. The order placed on the 3rd was delivered on the 11th.",

    "Hopefully future versions of these products will be better in that regard.",
    "These square ones don't have much decoration, so don't put gold thread on them. If they fall off, they'll get the car dirty and that's a hassle.",
    "The things are in good condition, the speed is good, and the two packages are different packaging",
    "It took 8 days, but it was fast. However, 2 items were sent in 2 packages, and the packaging was different. One was too thick, with thick cardboard and plastic, and the outer packaging was easy to open. The other was like a domestic express box, with a few cushioning air bags, which felt a bit shoddy.",

    "What kind of self-made goods.",
    "The goods are not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said \"I will contact the supplier for you\". It is claimed that it is self-operated. It is too shameless, and it is shameless to deceive consumers!",

    "I have been buying things from Amazon for a long time, and the quality is good. This time I thought I would buy it here. It's the first time I've bought a filter from Amazon. I feel that it's not good. It starts to have water scale early, and the filter is used until the 28th day. There are floating black carbon powder. I don't know whether to continue to use it or throw it away. I'm very depressed.",
    "Nice to see I was missed , she thought.",

    "Generally the sound is very good, the main problem is the talking.",
    "I bought a water filter for the first time, and after reading several reviews, I chose LAICA because it seemed to have a good price/performance ratio. After receiving the product, I installed the filter according to the instructions, and tried it out. I felt that it was generally good, but when pouring water, it seemed that the raw water would mix with the processed water at the spout (the raw water tank was not sealed tightly).",

    "Second Totes, 1. This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The umbrella handle is made of a mediocre material 3. It says Large, but it's really just a convenient umbrella for one person, two people would probably be too much.",
    "Instead, the one I bought from Meiya can be used by three people without pressure.",
    "I just think it's not right.",
    "Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms when pressed, secondly, the design of the back to prevent the ABS from scratching the box surface when placed flat does not work, thirdly, the inside of the box is just a piece of cloth, and the pull rod is prominent... etc., various dissatisfaction, and finally, the zipper is not very smooth.",
    "PS: The wheel feels really good.",
    "Can they do that and still be trusted?",
    "Advantages: This double shoulder bag is quite exquisite, and looks durable.",
    "Disadvantages: the QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook can't be put in (can't it be a little longer), the zipper of this shoulder bag can be locked, but no lock is prepared for the buyer, which can't be called service-oriented.",
    "it's okay, but i don't know if it's real leather",
    "The overall feeling is not bad. I don't know if it is real leather or not. I can't make a blind evaluation.",
    "It can hold A4 size documents, and can hold up to 80 pages of thick documents, but it can't hold any box-shaped objects that are too thick or too hard (that can't be bent).",
    "The bag is soft, and the inner bag is divided into several parts, which is quite humanized. It is still quite good.",
    "I just got this one with a small sand pit on the bottom, is it because I'm not good enough?",
    "I'm too lazy to go back and forth to exchange, so I'll just put up with it.",
    "I give it four stars overall, but it's still worth it.",
    "ForRoyal \u5e2d\u5377\u5168\u7403 \u76f8\u673a\u80cc\u5e26 \u5355\u53cd\u80cc\u5e26",

The camera is fixed and protected by soft material on the chest, unlike other quick shooters who fix the bottom of the camera with screws and damage the camera. It is also convenient to take photos.",
    "Their aftersales service is rubbish.",
    "I bought the guitar one and a half months ago, and it is missing a part. After notifying Amazon, I was given a phone number for after-sales service. After multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this!",
    "I think it will be more troublesome to repair it after the problem. I expect my friends who have good after-sales service to go around. It is too much trouble!",
    "there are some small defects, but the tone is good.",
    "The head of the qin has a defect, it is missing a corner, so it feels like a defective product, and there is no gift, but the price is not bad, and the tone of the qin is also good.",
    "well, the first face card",
    "I have used it for a long time. Except that the bass cannot come out, it is still good overall.",
    "We cannot imagine such a meal.",
    "I bought it for the first time, and there was a problem with the product. All the lights were flashing and it couldn't be used.",
    "I asked for the exchange of goods, but the goods have been in Shanghai for three days and they still haven't sent them over.",
    "I didn't answer the phone to my boss.",
    "The express company said that they only have that contact.",
    "Amazon can't find a place to complain.",
    "I didn't ask for it, but I got a text message saying that the delivery will be delayed.",
    "And then he said something about the transit issue.",
    "After all, the poor shopping experience made me doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.",
    "I hope that I do almost as well to-night.",
    "the label is too sticky and not waterproof",
    "Although Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not covered with film; the label is very sticky, and it is not suitable for cable labels, which is easy to fall off. Friends who buy it to organize cables should pay attention to it.",
    "The pen is okay, but the packaging is too simple, just a cardboard box, with no protection, and the box that holds the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent tape, and the glue is all over the box when you tear it off.",
    "I was very disappointed in this purchase.",
    "but no worries!",
    "I hope that the packaging will be improved in the future!",
    "I can only write for so long before my writing quality rapidly declines.",
    "The front desk staff were extremely kind and helpful.",
    "I have been using 925-25 for a long time, it is great. I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is great, and the style is also very beautiful. I gave it four stars because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and the pen cap adjusts the length of the lead a bit. My personal opinion: 925-25 is more convenient than 85.",
    "So I became a die-hard Amazon fan.",
    "I bought it at a super low price, but my child doesn't like the point reader.",
    "I opened the package and tried to apply for a refund, but they actually came to pick it up for free.",
    "Great to have ya Cowboy!",

    "I hope it won't be abused.",
    "I'll buy the books from here on out.",
    "the earphones are off, and there's static noise",
    "This earphone is really garbage. I don't know if it's my ears or if this earphone is really not as good as before.",
    "I bought a blue one from some easy two years ago, and the sound quality is not bad, no noise, and the bass is also good. I used it for two years and it was broken, so I planned to buy another one (urbeats), because I felt it was not bad.",
    "I saw a purple one that looked nice, so I bought this one. When I opened it today, I felt that something was wrong. One side of the sound is loud, and the other side is quiet.",
    "I thought it was the sound effect of the song at first, so I didn't think much about it. But after listening to it for a while, I found that the problem was serious. It was not only the problem of the pitch, but also the problem of the bass effect. It was not as good as the one I had before. There were also some noises. Is this phenomenon only in the purple one I bought? Or is the current earphone manufacturing technology really not good?<",
    "I was disappointed with the poor evaluation.",
    "I have to return the goods tomorrow.",

    "1. The front panel and the knob are made of plastic.",
    "2. The rear panel audio input jack and speaker output terminals are all bad. It is better to find a 1000-2000 CD amplifier all-in-one machine than this model.",
    "3. The top cover is thin, and my transformer is sunken, so I have to open the box and restore it by hand. The top cover and the front panel are loose.",
    "4. The whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, so it is very awkward to move.",
    "It feels like a SONY starter machine, just the workmanship, Malaysian made.",
    "I feel that Sony should put its production in China rather than in Xiaomi.",
    "5. The machine is hot. The top cover of the two-track movie for two hours is touched by hand, and it is about 40-50\u00b0C. It is not clear whether the transformer is too large to generate heat.",
    "Nowadays, switching power supplies are used more often. This big transformer is estimated to weigh 4KG.",
    "Sony should use a silent fan to actively cool the machine. After opening the box, I only saw a large aluminum heat sink on the tube.",

Fortunately, there was no stubble in the blade. If it was not returned, it would be",

    "I bought it for 280 yuan during the activity, which is a good bargain for ASICS. Of course, there are even lower prices in the comments.",

When I opened it, all the parts were just placed in the empty box. Fortunately, the toy quality was good and there were no broken parts. It was just too small.

    "The production of shoddy goods, the sale of shoddy goods, and the result of shoddy service. The six watches bought for the children are not consistent in time. The difference is as much as 10 hours.",
    "I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch was checked for time when it was in stock. They replied \"yes\", so why is the time so different? That's obviously a fake product. I'm not saying that in a mean way. Look, there are obvious quality problems (the numbers are not shown completely) that are sold. Are they garbage products?",
    "I contacted the seller, who gave me a lot of excuses and blamed me for buying their products, and said that such products, such sellers, and such after-sales service would make no one dare to buy products on Amazon in the future.",
    "I don't recommend buying from this seller, you'll get a lot of garbage.",
    "Amazon shipping problems",
    "Upon receipt of the goods, inspection revealed:",
    "1. The packaging is severely damaged.",
    "2. The user manual has serious use creases.",
    "3. The watch doesn't work, the table lamp can't be charged, and the time can't be adjusted.",
    "4. Contact Amazon customer service, only send to the United States by express mail, and pay the postage fee later.",
    "5, the reason for 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.",
    "Whoever said shearing was easy?",
    "The time is not very accurate, it is about one second fast every day, and it has been more than two minutes fast after a few months of use.",
    "I used to use a Westinghouse watch, and I felt that it would not be a few seconds different in one or two years.",
    "The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the stopwatch function is a bit useless, as it is rarely used, and occasionally accidentally triggered.",
    "Solar-powered sports watch",
    "Advantages: solar charging does not need to worry about replacing batteries, has world time, multiple alarm clocks and reminders.",

    "Very satisfied with this watch.",
    "It is definitely a genuine product. I have checked it in the showroom. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful. The workmanship is fine. The material is sufficient. In addition, it is an imported mechanical movement. Therefore, it has a certain weight. It is incomparable to the so-called mechanical watches of several hundred yuan. This is a genuine product.",
    "The watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range. The watch packaging has a diamond certification, the 12 o'clock on the dial is a real diamond. It is very suitable to wear it yourself, and it is also very face-saving to give it as a gift.",
    "Bentley watches are really good.",
    "The worst of all shopping.",
    "On the night of September 23, my wife's mobile phone was dropped. I suddenly decided to order an 8P from Lazada Malaysia on Amazon. There was stock, but it was not a self-operated store and there was no price increase (I was secretly happy). Since it was not a self-operated store, the shipping was slow, and the system showed that the latest receipt would be on September 27.",
    "My wife is so upset because she has no mobile phone. She called me at 6:00 am the next day to ask me to think of a way. I went to JD.com and found that 256G could be delivered on the same day. I had to order another one.",
    "I got a new one, so I wanted to cancel the Amazon order right away.",
    "Since the order was placed at midnight, it is impossible to receive the express in the morning. At 7 o'clock, I called the customer service to cancel the order. The customer service replied that the order had been cancelled and asked me to wait for the text message.",
    "Well, I just patiently waited, and when I checked my mobile phone in the middle of the day, the order was still in the status of not shipped, so I immediately contacted the customer service to ask them to cancel the order as soon as possible, and the customer service replied that they had already operated OK.",
    "At 3 pm, I checked my order on my mobile phone and found that it was still there. I could only contact the customer service again to make it clear that I had called three times. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to send the goods!",
    "The customer service contacted the seller on my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would cancel the order after familiarizing with the system.",
    "But I was told by the seller that he knew it and would not ship it, so please rest assured.",
    "I checked the order status on Monday and it was shipped. I was speechless.",
    "Since I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call the customer service again.",
    "The handling afterwards was ridiculous, basically I said a step and the customer service person would do it.",
    "The order is still in the status of refused to be delivered, and is about to be re-sent!",

    "I've been looking at this camera for a long time, but I didn't buy it because of the price and other reasons, but this time I bought it because it was a package deal and the price was reasonable.",
    "Buying it afterwards, there was nothing wrong with it, but when connecting to the software, it couldn't connect, my home is TP router, and after surfing the Internet, I found that many people have this problem, and it took me more than two hours to change the settings of the router, and finally I used 360WIFI as the medium to solve it, and I called the customer service of Xiaomi during the process, and they didn't have any solution to this problem,",
    "Another thing worth noting is that the user comments on the Internet say that the camera supports the smallest storage card of 8G, and the storage capacity smaller than that cannot be recognized. Please pay attention to this point.",
    "It feels okay to use, the screen is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine is heated to a certain extent, if it is always on, I feel that this degree of heating is a bit difficult to accept.",
    "In summary, this product still has many shortcomings, and I hope you will be careful when you buy it.",

Some people don't want to meet in their life. Some things don't want to know in their life. But what can we do?",
    "How many times I saw the Samsung mobile phone, the brain recalled her, the pain came to fill the whole body, I never used more than 2,000 yuan mobile phone, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate, but a person is good, but one day when she changed her mind, all the mountain oath and sea oath disappeared.",
