    "I thought it was amazing like an iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase, even though I changed it to Android version 9.",
    "I noticed that it is a little bit too big, it doesn't have a strap hole, *it can be fixed by a case with a strap hole, I haven't tested its waterproofness yet, it is a little bit heavy, I haven't used it much yet, but I am satisfied with it, I recommend it."
