    "The global outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.",
    "In many countries, the disease has left healthcare institutions struggling to cope, and nearly collapsed, and the restrictions imposed by governments have caused serious disruption to the global economy.",
    "The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it is likely to have far-reaching implications.",
    "Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs because restrictions on movement also limit the availability of precursors and basic chemicals.",
    "Traffickers may have to find new routes and methods because of travel restrictions and are unable to cross the border.",
    "The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hampered.",
    "The transformation brought about by the new coronavirus pneumonia is unprecedented, but some lessons can be learned from past crises.",
    "After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug addicts began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, switching to injecting drugs.",
    "At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.",
    "If governments respond in the same way to the current economic downturn, interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risky behaviours and drug treatment services could be hit hard.",
    "In addition, the priority of interception and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to act.",
    "Some countries have large quantities of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that drug trafficking in these countries will be directly affected the most.",
    "Messengers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their carry-on bags or hidden in their personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air travel in almost all places, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely suspended.",
    "Although international postal services have also been disrupted, there may be an increase in trafficking activities using the dark web and freight mail.",
    "In the long run, the economic downturn and related lockdowns may disrupt the drug market.",
    "With rising unemployment and lack of opportunity, poor and vulnerable people are more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug addiction and turn to illegal activities related to drugs, whether they are produced or transported.",
    "Drug trafficking groups may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.",

    "In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, and in 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of the global population.",
    "Over the past two decades, the rate of increase in drug abuse in developing countries has been much faster than in developed countries.",
    "This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth over this period, which was 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth in developing countries in the light years.",
    "Adolescents and young adults account for the largest proportion of drug users.",
    "In the period 2000-2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.",
    "Urbanization is a driver of the current and future drug market",
    "Drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas, whether in developed or developing countries.",
    "The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale migration of people from rural to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared with 34% in 1960.",
    "Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more prominent.",
    "Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the disease is most prevalent among the poorest people in the world, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.",
    "Drugs such as cocaine are more closely linked to the richer regions of the world.",
    "Similarly, in the interior of each country, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthy.",
    "But the higher rate of drug addiction is in people with lower socioeconomic status.",
    "Data from a few countries show a link between harmful patterns of drug use and disease and low income.",
    "These patterns seem to be less common in the wealthier social classes.",
    "The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus pneumonia crisis are likely to increase the risk to the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have been linked to an increase in drug abuse in the past, and the epidemic has forced millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.",
    "The coronavirus pandemic, which could lead to a further expansion of the drug market, could lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illegal cultivation of species, or because of a decrease in the control capacity of national authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the context of an economic crisis.",
    "The restrictions associated with the novel coronavirus have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, which may have increased maritime trafficking, and the risk of interception at sea is low, and there is more smuggling by air or land.",
    "Recent reports indicate that cocaine cargo is being transported directly from South America by sea to Europe.",
    "Increased complexity",
    "The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but new types of opioids with potential dangers are increasing the market for drugs and becoming more complex.",
    "In addition to cannabis, cocaine, and plant-based substances such as heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control, and the non-medical use of drugs is also growing rapidly.",
    "The domestic market of member countries has about 500 new active substances per year.",
    "Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.",
    "Although the total amount of the new psychoactive substance has stabilized, the proportion has changed.",
    "Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioid-type new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.",
    "Many of the new opioid psychoactive substances are similar to fentanyl, and their efficacy and harm have been proven to cause overdose deaths in North America, and in other areas, but to a lesser extent.",
    "In North America, fentanyl is used as a mixture for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, and as a counterfeit opioid.",
    "Some evidence suggests that new psychoactive substances are also injected into Europe: a study of waste syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes contained new psychoactive substances that produced an excitatory effect.",
    "The use of new psychoactive substances may become increasingly entrenched in the underprivileged",
    "A single new type of psychoactive substance has hardly ever formed a large market.",
    "But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabis is a serious problem among marginalized groups such as the homeless and prisoners.",
    "Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabis as the main challenge.",
    "Controls on precursor chemicals have forced drugmakers to innovate, and many chemicals commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as benzodiazepines, methylphenidate, and acetaminophen have been placed under international control.",
    "Drug dealers and drugmakers have been looking for alternatives to not only more regulated substances, but also chemicals designed to evade regulation, the so-called \"spectacular precursors.\"",
    "Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia are likely to further squeeze out poisoners who rely on precursor chemicals.",
    "Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has already become a reality: in March 2020, it was reported that a shortage of methylphenidate precursors imported from East Asia led to a rise in methylphenidate prices in Mexico and the United States.",
    "The market is changing.",
    "Synthetic drugs replace opioids in Central Asia and the Russian Federation",
    "The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.",
    "The number of opioids seized by Russian federal authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has decreased significantly.",
    "But the market for stimulants seems to be booming.",
    "There is evidence that methylphenidate and various carcidians, including methylphenidate and a-methylphenidate, are now widely available on the Russian drug market.",
    "Russian authorities report that the number of secret processing sites for the manufacture of various illegal drugs recently seized has increased dramatically, doubling in two years to 152 in 2018.",
    "Growth in the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq",
    "As early as 2012, investigations of hospital, prison and other institutional personnel revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.",
    "Crystalline methylphenidate has become another major drug of concern in addition to fentanyl and quimper.",
    "A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users saying that cannabis is harder to obtain than fentanyl or methamphetamine.",
    "Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methylphenidate processing sites, and the Narcotics Control Bureau has expressed concern about the large-scale import of counterfeit methylphenidate preparations, and the use of these preparations as precursors.",
    "In Afghanistan, methylphenidate production appears to have begun in 2014.",
    "Since then, methylphenidate amide has been steadily increasing in quantity.",
    "However, the catch of squid in the first half of 2019 was 1.657 kg, a significant increase compared to the previous year.",
    "The large-scale seizure of methylphenidate, believed to have originated in Afghanistan, in other countries also indicates that production in the country is rising rapidly.",
    "Policy changes and trends",
    "Most of the jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical cannabis use have an increasing trend of cannabis use.",
    "Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of cannabis.",
    "In the two states that first passed the legislation, Colorado and Washington, the use of cannabis by adults for non-medical purposes has increased, especially in the past month, and daily or almost daily use has increased, exceeding the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, almost doubling in the last month.",
    "This indicates that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and frequent use of cannabis.",
    "Short-term data from Canada also shows that while the legal market expanded in 2018 and 2019, the use of cannabis is also increasing.",
    "However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources.",
    "Is the legalization of cannabis behind the global decline in cannabis seizures?",
    "In 2018, global cannabis harvests fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in North America, where cannabis harvests have fallen 84% in the past decade.",
    "In comparison, the pattern of almost double-digit cannabis catches in other parts of the world during the same period suggests that policies aimed at unlocking the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.",
    "The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect. The regulatory effect of new psychoactive substances in the country is still difficult to assess.",
    "Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of new psychoactive substances use.",
    "In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after the adoption of domestic legislation.",
    "Opioids, a medication used for pain management and sedation, are unevenly distributed in high-income countries.",
    "In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opiates available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.",
    "About 50% are in North America, 40% are in Europe, and 2% are in Oceania.",
    "These countries account for about 12% of the world's population.",
    "It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88% of the world's population, but less than 10% of the world's population consumes pharmaceutical opiates.",
    "Barriers to accessing opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.",
    "The poorest people are at greater risk of drug addiction, with about 35.6 million people suffering from drug addiction in 2018.",
    "Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. Research in high-income countries has confirmed this. In these studies, the adverse socioeconomic trajectory of individuals is not only related to their condition at a certain point in time, but also to the risk of drug addiction.",
    "Drug addiction also exacerbates socioeconomic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby fostering a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to the humiliating attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.",
    "Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, people of diverse sexual orientation, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be overwhelmed by drug addiction or have problems accessing treatment services.",
    "According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the harmful effects of drug use on a broader range of societies have increased over the past decade.",
    "Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life expectancy due to drug use increased by 17% <unk>",
    "The disability-related adjusted life expectancy for liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common in injecting drug users, increased by a particularly high rate, reaching 40%.",
    "The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.",
    "Limited data from a global scale suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.",
    "But alcohol seems to play a bigger role in violent incidents than drugs.",
    "While drug use can lead to crime, in some cases, this association can be attributed in part to a variety of mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.",
    "The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.",
    "If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out in a non-violent context.",
    "In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the number of trafficking, but on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group over another.",
    "Recent trends",
    "Cannabis is the most commonly used substance, with opioids being the most harmful.",
    "It is estimated that 1.92 billion people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.",
    "In comparison, 58 million people used opiates in 2018.",
    "But the associated dangers of opioids are ignored due to the low number of users.",
    "Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and of the 21 million years of life lost to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.",
    "Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by cocaine; in North America, by fentanyl. These two regions have little in common in terms of economic, demographic, or general drug use patterns, but are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by readily available and inexpensive drugs.",
    "In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.",
    "In 2018, of the 67,367 overdose deaths reported in the United States, two-thirds involved fentanyl.",
    "Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.",
    "Part of the reason for fentanyl overdose deaths is the unpredictability of fentanyl in the illicit drug market.",
    "In West Africa, Central Africa and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of quinoa has grown significantly.",
    "In the region, more and more patients are receiving treatment for the disease using quimby.",
    "In 2017, the number of global seizures of rhino sharks increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "But in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate the sport of wrestling, global whaling dropped to 32 percent.",
    "The crisis is due to the simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation of Quimard and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.",
    "Compounding the crisis is the availability of these substances in both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making them more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.",
    "Increased use of stimulants",
    "The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.",
    "About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine became popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "About 27 million people used benzodiazepines in the same year, of which methylbenzodiazepines were the most used benzodiazepines in Southeast Asia and North America.",
    "According to most indicators available, the use of methylphenidate has been increasing in these two regions for the past 20 years.",
    "In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes alternating, so that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, sometimes increasing and decreasing simultaneously to meet the demand of the same market.",
    "New coronavirus pneumonia increases the risk of injecting drug users",
    "It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.",
    "More than 1 million people infected with HIV from injecting drug users, and 5.5 million people infected with hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, about 5.85 million people died from drug use, half of them from hepatitis C-induced liver disease, and injection drug users' hepatitis C is still largely untreated.",
    "Opioid shortages caused by restrictions on novel coronavirus pneumonia may lead users to substitute alcohol or more readily available substances such as benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.",
    "As some users switch to injection or more frequent injection, more harmful uses may occur.",

    "It's not enough to not have a card, you buy it yourself, and you've bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.",
    "There's a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, this time there's no sticker, there's a sticker like that when you buy a phone, you can put it on the warranty card, this time there's no sticker.",
    "I'm confused as to whether it's cheaper or not.",
    "Waiting for a response from the supplier",
    "The packaging has no markings, call the supplier directly, answer no markings are genuine, if you suspect that the edge material can be mailed to the company's check, also leave the license plate number and phone number, promise to send a text message to notify you to enter my information to the company's online warranty card, so far have not received a text message?",
    "I got the oil in the morning, changed it in the afternoon.",
    "Second purchase.",
    "Amazon's self-service products are still reassuring",
    "The oil-changing master said the oil was clean, it was really good oil.",
    "Because it's the second time I've bought it.",

    "Chinese customer service: I'm sorry, we brought you a loss, we gave you two ways to go:",
    "1, you return the goods, the buyer bears all the shipping costs.",
    "2, if you don't return the goods, we will compensate you 1,000 yen.",
    "(I counted, the shoes were over 4,000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I don't have shoes, lost 200 yuan)",
    "I've got a pair of shoes, I've finally compensated myself for 2,000 yen, I've finally lost 150 rmb customer service: we've recorded it, we'll take it seriously, the next day I returned the mail, saying I don't accept Chinese customer service, that's it.",
    "I suggested: when buying pages like 7c, 8c, 9c, this is a confusing option, Chinese customers helped me say that the Japanese common code is not going to bring c like this, similar to 140 like this, but do you have to go to other caterpillar pages to see?",
    "There are cases of mixed characters in both Japanese and American characters.",
    "I'm not sure why you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, it's the smallest scale, what do you mean by that?",
    "Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we don't know if you're going to be shipped back to China, so your shipping costs are not compensated.",
    "This logic I don't understand, I'm Japanese, I still want Chinese clothes, living in Japan China doesn't need Chinese clothes, going to Japan tourists, no that kung fu playing international long distance, then the problem comes, what people need to call Amazon to buy Chinese phones abroad, no more like I did today",
    "Amazon Chinese customer service isn't the only thing that makes it easier for these people in our sea?",
    "This time I'm not satisfied.",
    "This is the second time I've bought diapers from Amazon, I bought a box when I was two months old, I chose European imported paper diapers, the first time I bought a diaper, I was satisfied, the baby used a diaper all night, it could really last 12 hours without changing diapers.",
    "But this time I bought an L-numbered diaper, it had two separate packages in one box, and when I opened it, I felt that the paper was loose, there was a clear difference between the input and the helping baby, and after giving it to the baby, it was fine, there was no urine leakage and no signs of rashes.",
    "But by the time the second pack of diapers arrived, the red rash had appeared on the inside of the baby's thigh, and it hasn't gone away yet.",
    "I'm guessing 2 bags in 1 box, the quality is different.",
    "I don't think I'll be buying any more!",
    "Hoping to focus on transportation protection of packages",
    "I've been buying online for so long, and I've seen the worst packaging ever, no protection at all, no buffer bubbles, no buffer material in the package, nothing at all.",
    "It's a box of deformed boxes.",
    "And the cardboard boxes inside are compressed and deformed.",
    "Hopefully it's genuine, the quality is guaranteed, and then why don't you dare to buy something from Amasun?",
    "I'd rather have half the country's wealth, with some security.",
    "I've been thinking about packaging for a while now, and I've seen reviews from people who have been doing it for 19 years, and it's still the same.",
    "It's far too far away from the domestic JDT and other cat-like services.",
    "Good look, but a little bit of regret.",
    "The color of the whole cup is what I like, orange-red, although my family is male, but I still think orange-red matches yellow with bright eyes.",
    "It's smaller than I thought it would be, but it's meant to be taken out of the door, so it's acceptable.",
    "I tried it at home last night, and after the bottle cap was pushed open, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the position of the straw was vertically, so my son always had to put the protrusion on the lid to hold water, wondering if this place could be improved.",
    "It seems that other brands of straw cups have a slanted straw made of straw, which is a good thing for small children, because they really care about safety and comfort.",
    "Light and large capacity",
    "I like it light, open-mouthed, that's two separate compartments that are a little excessive for me, I don't know what to wear.",
    "After buying it, I found out that there was another brand that was very similar to the one that was bought overseas, but it was less than 200 yen.",
    "Fake goods are especially harmful.",
    "Amazon sells counterfeit goods, and I'm addicted too.",
    "The customer said that he couldn't return it because he used it, and I don't know why it's fake.",
    "Because of trust, so sad, after all, it's a disgraceful item, really go to the physical store and buy it, recognize it as something precious.",
    "Because it's a second killing, so I didn't watch the review, I've submitted the e-commerce platform to the National Bureau of Industry and Commerce, let's defend it together.",
    "Is that bad?",
    "Is it fake?",
    "In short, a tragedy.",
    "The second one was a little bit of a hairy one, but it opened up a little bit of a weird smell, and I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one, and then I couldn't stand the whole thing when I put it on my face, it was a very pungent smell, indescribable, and I coughed and coughed, and my eyes hurt, and I cried, and I took it off and washed my face.",
    "Unbelievingly, a piece of the same coin was opened, but it didn't taste so heavy, and now it's being painted.",
    "It reminds me of the taste of inferior hair salon water.",
    "Can't imagine how hard it is to avoid the Amazon's self-care products?",
    "You adulterer!",
    "When you buy, the event page says 99 yuan gift, three full sets, received the goods without this gift, call customer service to tell them to see the screenshot of the event, the question is who bought the goods and saved the screenshot of the website, you yourself did the event, you also need to help you, next time buyers to keep an eye, save the evidence",
    "Using the afterthought",

    "I think this is really good anyway.",
    "The order was placed on the 27th, received on the 12th, and delivered in 15 days, which is half a month.",
    "The second is that Amazon's Black Friday is not a good idea, and it's not a good idea to wait two days to get it, because it's cheaper than 12 cents, which means I've bought more than 170 (plus the cost of transportation), and there's a sense of price-fixing.",
    "I've been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days, which means that this way, the price doesn't fluctuate much.",
    "The price is affordable, Japanese, Chinese label, with particles, definitely back!",
    "The grease in the body has particles, the freshness is just right, the back teeth are smooth, the top is much stronger than the other hand, there are things that are imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels, I do not know where they are shipped from",
    "In the future, as long as there is an Amazon, there will be no more second-hand toothpaste.",
    "For advice, why sometimes Amazon's apps don't work, hopefully some applications will improve, the better the better!",
    "The more these years go by, the worse it gets, there is no quality of service at all!",
    "The garbage is so good that it doesn't take into account the needs of the customers, and the delivery time is 19:00-22:00 when the order is placed.",
    "It is convenient to receive items only at night because the bed is inconvenient for the elderly who have surgery at home.",
    "The result was that at 12 noon, it was delivered directly to the door, without any prior phone call.",
    "If the delivery time is what you want the courier to think about, why waste time letting the customer choose?",
    "If your logistics can't guarantee your service, then don't be an e-commerce company!",
    "Let an old man with three wounds in his body get out of bed and open the door to pick up the courier and pay for the change!",
    "Please note that the order contains a contact number!",
    "No one has called to explain!",
    "The so-called complaint service of the Internet is a bunch of outsiders dressed up there, spread your complaint and give you a so-called answer.",
    "There will be no change or compensation!",
    "I've had this problem before, but this time I can't stand it, it's too much!",
    "If the cover and the bottom of the new book are the opposite of what they were before and after the pre-sale, and the quality is obviously a problem, then why did the book go to the customer?",
    "No one will contact you if you leave a bad review.",
    "The more these years go by, the worse it gets, there is no quality of service at all!",
    "I don't want to spend any more money on excellence.",
    "The quality of the images is unacceptable.",
    "As a title for a collection of ancient maps, the book is unacceptably vague in its choice of images, typography, and printing, with some images even having mosaics that are blurred to the point of being indistinguishable.",
    "Even if the book is not a professional map book, even if it is a small painting illustration, it should be able to afford the vast medieval documentation left by the ancestors in the catalogue!",
    "What's the difference between using a picture like this to put together a book and not using a picture?",
    "I'm sorry for this kind of discipline.",
    "The text is not evaluated, and each family has its own distinction.",
    "Two stars overall.",
    "When I was in high school, I was bored with this book, and I didn't think I'd be interested in it, because the online literature of the beginning didn't appeal to me.",
    "And then... it fell into the pit.",
    "According to this plot, the whole book is relatively easy and pleasant, the first part of the book is still in the online tour, even if it is a heart-to-heart battle between the public, because it is often done by the blood of the god of leaves, it is not heavy.",
    "As for the part of the contest, I wrote a little bit of a feeling of bitterness (maybe my own sadness) about the change of times.",
    "It took me a lot of time to learn the whole book, but I couldn't stop.",
    "The character of the full-time character and the depiction of the emotional line are very surprising, some characters are only occasionally brought, and will also leave a very deep impact, like the character of the more focused character of the full-time character of the full-time character of the full-time character of the full-time character of the full-time character.",
    "And in the online world of love, there is no such thing as a sickeningly good-looking woman who wants to be a beauty or a corrupt woman, and all the people have a common place in their feelings is that they love to honor this game, and most of them want to win the prize.",
    "There's no big plot in small measurements, everyone looks so simple and cute.",
    "This may also be why there are no disgusting roles in the full-time job.",
    "The full-time IP is huge, and it's all thanks to this.",
    "This cultural phenomenon is not discussed, and the full-time job is not a good book.",
    "How much he really gives people some warmth, a little bit of emotion.",
    "In April of this year, the full-time job will be animated.",
    "I've been wanting to buy this book for a long time, and I've never had a thick wallet, so I thought I'd give it a try, and then when I wanted to buy it, I found out that it was a fake, and it was a fake, and it was a fake, and I liked the cover, but I was going to buy the old version first, so I looked it up on Amazon, and I bought it once.",
    "Let's talk about the situation next.",
    "The fourth book is uncovered, but the book is new.",
    "The 17th book is sealed, but it's been opened, and the texture of the book is strange, and there's no other hardcover.",
    "The 23rd and 17th are the same, but they're also harder than the 17th, but they're very old.",
    "The publishing house of the different books is different, as if the 23rd and the 17th were the same publishing house, and different from the others.",
    "Overall, I'm satisfied with 24 boxes, which is a lot.",
    "The little lion",
    "When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as a lost corner, but the result was a lot of words!",
    "After three meditations, a little lion, who loves to eat fruit juice and soft sugar, opened his gun and gave it to the children.",
    "When the lion eats the hunter in this plot, the heart is slightly uncomfortable, and modern urban people are a little uncomfortable with this arrangement of being eaten by animals.",
    "Finally, seeing this little lion who has succeeded in human society, lost himself, he is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete man.",
    "Finally, there was only the back of the little lion, who didn't know where he was going.",
    "Perhaps years later, the image of this little lion will remain in the minds of grown-up children, and one day, unintentionally, it will be remembered, perhaps touched or inspired by her.",

    "The shipment was so fast, I spit it out here, the courier brother, the precious items were put in the door room, the flight was so fast, I couldn't open the box with him, the test was meaningless at this point.",
    "The merchant thought of the customer before sending the goods.",
    "Businessmen are more responsible, they call specifically to ask about the screen size of the camera, and they actually think for the customer.",
    "The shipping speed is also fast.",
    "The gold-plated film is also suitable for use in pipes.",
    "Battery not charged",

    "The book was posted on March 31st on the device, the content is blank, just wait and see, and the e-book on Amazon is down to 18 yuan;",
    "3. Two days of repeated attempts to delete the blank book downloaded from the device, synchronized again, were unable to access the electronic version containing the actual content, the nature of the business, but seeing the Amazon official website already previewing the book",
    "I'm a little confused right now.",
    "The price is not the most important issue, the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with a book with real content, instead of downloading it forever.",
    "2. The book you pre-ordered shouldn't be bought again, because if you buy a ticket and download a book with no content, the process looks very complicated;",
    "3. Hopefully Amazon will give you a normal channel to respond to this kind of problem, when you download e-books or use them to raise questions, there will be a place to respond (work forms can be served online, you can refer to Microsoft's official website how to do it)",
    "Not very recommended.",
    "I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it in my memory, so I thought I'd read it later.",
    "The book is a collection of short stories, rather than a collection of fragments about love in life.",
    "The book's handwriting is extremely plain, it's the plainness of the white water, the sentence-making is extremely simple, the plot is like a street in the summer afternoon, the silence is plain.",
    "Each short story is a clip from a short period of ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.",
    "Finally gathered together, the title <unk> When we talk about love, what are we talking about?",
    "I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of art of action, the author wants to express that love is not only a sad separation on the stage, the sea of dry stones in urban legends, not only the paint of your mother's house, love is not only above and should not be represented above, love is also a dull life, a dull and tasteless day and night, there is also a desperate escape from life, a reality.",
    "When you read this book, you may think back to the couple you were fighting with, the unhealthy marriage of the person you knew, and the unpleasant feelings you had.",
    "That's why I don't recommend reading it, because from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and the plot of the book are completely tasteless, unless your life is as scary or sweet as living in a candy castle, otherwise you have to read it with a sense of wonder and boredom.",
    "And from a deeper perspective, the daily plot doesn't give you a glimpse or expand your mind and your vision (unlike Marx's \"Love in the Time of Trouble\"), and the short segment doesn't explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?",
    "Are the reasons for the breakdown of the main character's marriage?",
    "So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't mean much if you don't read it.",
    "The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and style than through storylines, which is also the reason why the reading experience is worse.",
    "It's not suitable for reading, it's not suitable for looking at.",
    "The book is logical, but not rich enough.",
    "Explains a lot of sales theories about what and why, but is weak in how to do it, just points the direction but doesn't give a concrete approach.",

    "Examples include both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and famous unknown people.",
    "I don't know if it's a story that's being compiled for example, but it's more convincing if it's based on the experiences of some of the authors.",
    "Changing the name of the customer or the client.",
    "The title is \"customer\", but the text is \"customer\".",
    "The e-book also contains the problem of misspelling the characters, misspelling the punctuation, and misspelling the number.",

    "A quick guide to understanding Internet finance",
    "This book is very simple, it's just an introductory lesson, it can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, or to dig deeper by clicking on the image.",
    "And the book was written earlier, and the content of the subsequent Alipay WeChat subsidy war cultivated user habits is not mentioned, and now the third-party payment share is only afraid that it is not as small as the one mentioned in the book.",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat with their phones, and businessmen have abandoned the bank because of the high water flow.",
    "But I'm very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book, because it shows that the author has at least several years of experience in financial observation, and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so that he can write such a common and easy-to-understand content.",

    "Indeed, for the national people, most of the \"love you in your heart\" is hard to say, even if there is love, gratitude and praise are silently put in the heart and not spoken.",
    "The author describes five languages of praise in the book: affirmative speech, careful timing, service, praise, gifts, body touch.",
    "I think it's important not to know what the five languages of praise are, but to be able to use them from the bottom of your heart at any time, anywhere, to praise and thank the people around you, whether it's family, friends or colleagues.",

    "Thank you again to the authors and translators and the editors for their hard work!",
    "Suspected counterfeit goods, please Amazon strictly review",
    "The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, even worse than the roadside landing products, there is no weight, there is no barcode, the ten-pack packaging is also loose, it is not a characteristic of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, it has applied for a refund; it is completely a quality problem; it is recommended that merchants wipe their eyes, refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought a heart photo, supermarket 23 yuan roll, added a few comparison photos, to further verify the inferiority of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference!",

    "The Benefits:",
    "1. Large brands, cheap prices",
    "Advantage 2: The motor and blade are all guaranteed by Panasonic, it's OK to use, but there's a gap between my expectations.",
    "Disadvantages",
    "1. Charging without an indicator, this is the most basic of your power indicators are saved, estimated to buy 300 yuan worth of products customers, in the eyes of Panasonic, is also a waste, no respect",
    "2. There is a strong odor when charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.",
    "I tried it for a day in the office, and it tasted like plastic all over the house.",
    "Compared to the Philips Philips I used before, although it has more blades, but the Panasonic product, the quality is really unfortunate for the consumer.",
    "Small packages",
    "When you get the courier, you see the e-commerce version written on it, and you know it's in the pit, it's better than the one you bought in the supermarket, it's probably M, it's not packaged the same as the picture on the product introduction, it's the new version.",

    "A heartbreaking shopping experience",
    "The package had already been signed, and the colleagues around him said they didn't help sign it, and they were in a hurry to contact the courier company, but they said they had to send it to start the inquiry, contacted Amazon, and waited for more than ten days, and finally they found out that the courier had been mistakenly sent to someone else, and how many weeks later they finally took it back, the package had been disassembled, the goods were still intact, and it was not used.",
    "Mismatched map",
    "I was able to get a pair of headphones that looked like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to get a pair of headphones that looked like Figure 2, and even if the images were not the same, the size of the headphones and the sound were different.",
    "Although the names are the same, but I hope that everyone can be careful, in addition, I would like to ask Amazon to be responsible for replacing the correct image in a timely manner, thank you very much.",
    "Operating system in general",
    "For a while, the overall picture was fine, it didn't make any difference, it was this system that made people look at the confusion, the startup time was obviously a little slow, and there was no way to do a good setup, and the software was unnecessary, the response speed was more general, and it wasn't a quantity compared to my colleagues.",
    "Looking at the reviews saying that the design is very human, I couldn't find where the human, the remote control is commonly used up and down, the return key design position is actually not daring to compliment.",
    "So let's make it a TV, and then add a TV box and so on.",
    "The price reduction is too bad.",
    "The price reduction is so bad, more than a hundred are now 99!",
    "There are a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I'm going to use a copy of the passage as a review.",
    "If I were to use this paragraph to rate, it would say that this product has at least 85 points or more.",
    "And for worse products, I'm not going to sneak around and copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers can use it as a reference when they buy, and merchants can improve the quality of their products.",
    "It's cheap, it's good, it's not hot, that's enough!",
    "It's a cheap line, but it's supposed to meet the HDMI certification standard, and it's a bit of a joke compared to the second-hand ones, and it's twice as expensive, and it's rough, and it's softer, and it's seven meters of noise, and it's twice as cheap!",
    "It's okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other sites.",
    "The order was found to be wrong, but the cancellation order could not be canceled, the website link to the online customer service has been showing the wrong connection, the link is not working.",
    "The delivery man called me, and I said, \"I don't want it anymore\", and I wanted to cancel the order, but I didn't, so I sent the delivery man to take it back, and he said, \"Give me a receipt first, and I'll apply for a refund\".",
    "It's the same as saying that you can't refund food once you've signed up, you can't call Amazon Customer Service, and you can't refund food once you've signed up.",
    "I've bought items that can't be returned in Kyoto and Suning, including milk, paper diapers, etc. I've given back all the clothes I've bought, and the clothes I've bought in Kyoto are too big to give back, and I can't give back the clothes I've bought in Amazon.",
    "Rules are dead, people are alive, connect you to customers, how do you deal with it?",
    "Tell me if I'm going to take it myself, if I'm going to let the delivery man buy it himself, it's not easy for the delivery man to send it to the family, what am I going to do to get the delivery man to buy something that he didn't buy?",
    "I didn't back down, I took it myself, but I had to give you a point for your service.",
    "Don't waste your money.",
    "First of all, I'm looking forward to buying, I think the brand shouldn't be bad, I've received the packaging and I think it's okay, the head is good, but the box is basically soft, the appearance is invisible, you have to feel it, eat it in the mouth, it's completely tasteless, bite the fruit, the color is dark yellow, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad!",
    "Eat a long, smart meal and never buy fruit from an e-commerce store again!",
    "Where are the counterfeit signs?",
    "The bottom of the bottle is a corner of the trap, which is probably caused by a strong impact, from the outside of the packaging bag, the level of the feeling of the hole makes one wonder, after all, the packaging of food is too simple, and it still belongs to international purchases, and there is no obvious anti-counterfeiting sign, the bottle is opened very easily, the key is the layer of honey inside the lid comes out directly, there is almost no adhesive, are foreign products like this?",
    "I don't understand it at all, I was born in China.",
    "It's supposed to be authentic, right?",
    "And when I got the 20th, this was the 14th, and I bought it overseas for the first time here, just to write down my doubts, maybe this is normal?",
    "Remittance services to be improved",
    "I bought a total of five vouchers, the first time I booked three, the result was only two, after many contacts, it was confirmed that the leak was a response to the need for replenishment; the second time I booked, I was in a hurry to rest, the website and WeChat did not indicate the need to book on weekdays, causing unnecessary panic, suggesting improvement later.",
    "Good shopping.",
    "East and West are good!",
    "It's still more convenient to buy things from abroad than it is to buy things from abroad, and the logistics time is a few days longer than in the country, so I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear goods from abroad to the country is still very strong, much faster than moving, so now many things are bought abroad.",
    "Hopefully the quality and price of domestic goods will be better, a lot of things are domestic, but it's cheaper to go out and buy them back than in the country, hoping to improve.",
    "Waste",
    "When I saw this package, I asked people, \"Don't you think it's trash on the side of the road?\"",
    "A plastic bag that's fragile, sent from Germany, is that packaging responsible?",
    "I see this kind of packaging is like packing garbage, buying this product, packing it and its simplicity, there is no measure to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packing, by hand, the package is completely deformed, the items in it are also damaged.",
    "If I just run into one of these, I admit, I bought a few of these, and I looked for Amazon clothes, and they said they could be returned, but they paid for the cost of the mattress, and then they returned the cost to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I'm trying to ask, I'm paying for shipping with cash, you give me back the gift card, that's to buy your gift card myself, or to mail the product to the German warehouse, that's not to buy a product!",
    "And I've been telling customers that it's their responsibility to ask who's responsible for this, and half the time I'm not saying it's their responsibility, and half the time I'm not even saying it's their responsibility, and what's the guarantee of this after-sales service?",
    "The quality is good, 5 stars, the logistics are bad.",
    "1, good quality, second-rate, medium price, and super-value.",
    "2, the solidity of the welding point is sufficient to ensure that the surface is treated with good color.",
    "The logistics are hard, the 3rd is under the bill, the 11th is the receipt.",
    "If Amazon hadn't said that the shipment would arrive on February 7th, I might be satisfied.",
    "5, but the indication of the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise, when the promise is not fulfilled, the user is difficult to fulfill.",
    "6 If you are not sure of what you are promising, do not make a promise.",
    "7 In fact, I am very much interested in the promises made by the merchants.",
    "8, so I scored low.",
    "The gold will fade.",
    "It still works, but whether it's obvious, it depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.",
    "There's a little bit that's not very good, it's the gold line, it's designed to look good, but actually, this gold line will fade, and it'll go on the car, and if you move it a few times, on your hand, and on the car, there'll be some gold powder.",
    "Hopefully the product will improve.",
    "This square, also without decorative effect, don't go to the gold line, fall down and get dirty on the car again.",
    "East and West are fine, speed is fine, two packages are different.",
    "The packaging is very fast, but it's two pieces divided into two packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously one is too seismic, thick cardboard is glued, the plastic layer is sealed, the outer packaging is also easy to take off, one is like a domestic courier box, put a few airbags, it's a bit of a stretch.",
    "The Yalan mattress is really good.",
    "The 34cm mattress is not very thick, so you can sleep on it without using it.",
    "The quality is good, whether it's front or back, it's soft, the sleep is comfortable, lying on it quickly falls asleep.",
    "After receiving the mattress, there was some confusion due to the fact that there were two violent transportation by courier, and the Yalan customer service was responsible and efficient in solving the problem.",
    "It's not a self-made product, Amazon is shameless.",
    "The page clearly states self-service, in fact, it is distributed by the supplier, after the sale is the responsibility of the supplier, if there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself.",
    "Want to cancel an order, sorry, order information has been passed to the supplier, can't be canceled; want to return a refund, successfully applied for a refund on Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, need to contact the supplier yourself to return the refund",
    "This is a self-service product.",
    "The goods are not delivered by Amazon, they are not shipped by Amazon, the customer service says \"I'll contact your supplier\", and claims to be self-employed, too shy, don't be naked, naked to deceive consumers!",
    "The experience of boredom",
    "The filter core that was previously purchased online at another home, the filter effect is good, after 28 days, use it for another one or two days and there is no water stain.",
    "I've been buying a lot of stuff on Amazon, and I've been buying it on this side, and I've been buying it on this side, and I've been buying it on Amazon for the first time, and it doesn't feel so good, and it's not just that it's starting to have water scales, and it's been used for 28 days, and it's got this little black carbon powder that's floating, and I don't know if I'm going to keep using it or just throw it away.",
    "It's not as good as I thought.",
    "Compared to the plugs I've used in the past, the exterior is generally done, the interior is not disassembled, but as the shopkeeper described, from the point of view of ease of use, each separate unit shows whether there is a lack of power.",
    "The packaging is damaged, wait for the time to check the quality of the product.",
    "The outer packaging is damaged more severely, the inside packaging box seems to be new, but the description book doesn't seem to be new, it was repaired in September, in the mail, hopefully it won't be bad by then, please explain why several customers mentioned the packaging damage, but you can be safe, thank you!",
    "Overall, good, a little problem",
    "The first time I bought a filter pot, I looked at a few reviews, I felt that the price of LAICA was higher than the price of this one, I received the book with the filter core, I tried it, it felt good overall, but when I poured water, it was as if the raw water would be mixed from the mouth of the pot with the water after treatment (the raw water tank was not sealed very tightly).",
    "When you use it, wait for all the water to be filtered and then pour it out!",
    "The picture is incomplete.",
    "The picture doesn't show the details on the side, the details on the side don't match the style of the subject, there's a big difference, this is one of them; this bead is Thai, there's no indication of where it came from, this is the second one; there's no indication of quality, this is the third one; when I bought in the UK, I distinguished each item with a box, here is only a simple plastic bag, and the bead has no product logo on it, where did I judge it was fake?",
    "Be careful when buying, especially things from Hong Kong.",
    "Amazon's customer service is terrible",
    "The order was received two days ago, and today it was found that it was 40 cents cheaper, it took a long time to find the customer's clothes, the customer said that he could not make up the difference, he could buy again and return the goods.",
    "This kind of customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than a baby in a foreign country.",
    "It's worth it as a beginner.",
    "It's better than the original, and it's not as good as the original, I've seen the price of the store before, it's a few hundred, I'm playing for the first time, I'm still walking.",
    "East and West are good.",
    "It's good to send a girlfriend, but it's unpleasant when I'm not in Canada at noon, the logistics company sends me a confirmation text message directly to the mailbox and doesn't send me a receipt, which hurts me.",
    "But the baby is really good.",
    "Worth buying",
    "It's so cute, the Amazon discount is so big, Zhou Zhen's official website sent it directly, he ordered it the night before, he got it this afternoon, it's so fast.",
    "The postman is also very responsible.",
    "Thank you!",
    "A confession from a customer",
    "1 Received this leftover item, Amazon customer service tells you not to rush, we will contact you in about 54 hours.",
    "Then in the middle you contact the customer service, they'll tell you that this problem has been handled by a specialist, and he'll tell you the results.",
    "You can't actively contact this specialist, you don't know her work number, you don't have a direct phone, you can't contact her, only she contacts you.",
    "The tragedy was that I waited almost three days for this specialist to contact me, my phone left the meeting, and I didn't get this specialist's phone.",
    "I waited two hours, and the phone did not come, and I contacted the Amazon customer service and sent a message to the customer service to call me back.",
    "It's been almost three days and I still don't know what the Amazon is going to do with the coffee machine that I received this leftover!",
    "Amazon's products are fine, overseas shopping is fine, but it's far from the service it provides to the U.S.",
    "6 For me, I can only wait...",
    "It's not cheap.",
    "The cooking is very good, all the expectations for this pot are very high, when you get your hands on it, you like it, it's very light, but when you open the pot, you find that the bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle is protruding, the edges are hollow, the oil runs all the way around, the cooking pot is specially bought, the fat is blown out, there is no way to cover the central area, the glue is blown, the cooking pot is not open,",

    "The designers processed the top into a tiny arc.",
    "It's supposed to be a very smooth line.",
    "Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.",
    "Because the top has two parts, the front is the control panel, the back is the water box top cover.",
    "The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are inconsistent, and a maximum difference of about 2 mm appears after the merger.",
    "Although it looks like a very small seam.",
    "But it's almost as if the whole design has been destroyed.",
    "What's wrong with the product designer?",
    "It seems that the product managers who are beautiful don't have the ability to create products of this level.",
    "(For the feedback of the saleswoman, of course, it can't be too high, but when I heard that all the bodies of this product are like this, not only is there a problem with this item that I bought, her unexpected and negative emotions made me understand that beauty can't be too high) 2019-7-7 Water pump failure has less water, the second repair, the first repair after two weeks is broken again",

    "Amazon's annual sales of the newest and most popular products, which are priced at $249,289,299, are a bit of a surprise, but the company is still selling the same products at a discounted price, and it's not just the price of the product, it's the price of the product.",

    "Let's start with the daily express, the airline is very fast, the service is very good!",
    "I've been using 925-25, it's great, I just got 925-85, the quality of the pen is not good, the style is also very beautiful, the reason for the four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjustment, the core length is a bit moving, personal opinion: 925-25 is better than 85",
    "So it became Amazon's death powder.",
    "It was bought at a super discounted price, so the kids didn't like how to read the pen.",

    "I didn't think much about the sound effect of the song at first, but after listening to it for half a day, I realized that the problem was very serious, not only the distortion, but also the bass effect, and I hadn't heard it before, but there was some confusion, is this the phenomenon of the purple one I bought? Or is it that the headphone manufacturing process is not working now?",

    "Finally, after countless phone calls, I received my computer on October 16th.",
    "As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because it was bought for someone else, let's add a comment later.",
    "I've bought it a few times in the last six months, and now it's not working properly, can I fix it?",
    "Because I have a desktop, I bought it and then I didn't use it for several times.",
    "It's just a few times when I'm on a business trip.",
    "Recently, it was discovered that when the power was turned on, it was not charging, so it was necessary to hold the charger and the connection of the wire with the left and right hands in order to charge the battery.",
    "I'm not sure if it's because the interface is not working properly, or if it's still being repaired.",
    "Amazon strongly advised to stop using EMS!",
    "Five stars for merchandise, one star for logistics, and an average of three stars.",
    "I don't know why Amazon sends EMS, it's not recognized in the industry, well, computers are also valuable!",
    "The order indicates that it is expected to arrive on the 20th, so the family has been waiting at home for three days!",
    "Why does it take four or five days to send from Yangon to Fuzhou?",
    "On the morning of the 22nd, the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to start the happy collection, as a result, in the evening, without receiving any phone calls or text messages, the logistics were checked, and at noon it was signed, and the person who showed it was signed!",
    "I was shocked!",
    "Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?",
    "I'm not sure I'm going to make it!",
    "I finally ran a generation to get the computer back.",
    "The specific reason is simply that because the courier brother turned the two single numbers upside down, it's better not to throw the item.",
    "I strongly advise Amazon not to use EMS, and I'm sure I won't buy another one if Amazon sends it by EMS.",
    "Good to go.",
    "I've been using it for a while now, and it's a good idea to buy it, but it's not a good idea to buy it, it's a bad idea to buy it, it's a bad idea to buy it, it's a bad idea to buy it, it's a bad idea to buy it, it's a bad idea to buy it, it's a bad idea to buy it.",
    "(By the way, don't go to a store called E-cool Digital Center, where the quality of the goods is poor, the products are not returned, the boss is full of dirty talk, especially exposure)",

    "The quality of the hard drive is very good, the price is absolutely high, it is cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, it is definitely recommended to buy if you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate logistics.",
    "But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still there, and when I swore a few years ago that it was absolutely useless, there was no improvement, you never find the actual logistics, the information is always sent a few weeks later, you can never complain, that's the bureaucracy!",
    "It's been a few days since the shipment was received, and the logistics information is still 10 days before you will receive the shipment!",
    "Logistics is not a concern",
    "It's not just packaged in a pressurized container, it's also packaged in an open container, and I don't know if it's packaged.",

    "When I got it, the sealed tape looked very wrong, like it had been removed, I took a picture in a hurry, it was torn, the cardboard inside was damaged, I was worried that someone else had left, I didn't get to the anniversary, I gave it to my husband to try, so there was no electricity, it was better that the knife head didn't have any dirt in it, otherwise the old man would have left!",
    "It's not known if it's going to be good or bad, or if it's going to be short-term, but it's not clear if it's going to be good or bad, or if it's going to be short-term.",

    "It's a very successful purchase.",
    "There are fakes.",
    "I bought two packs last time, and they were two different versions, and the word in the bottom left corner was green, so one pack wasn't, it was white, so the cat ate it and pulled its stomach.",
    "I'm not sure if it's the fake Amazon source or if it was dropped by the employees when it was shipped.",
    "I'll buy it again, and if it's fake, I'll have to go to your people.",
    "It's a cross!",
    "Amazon's image is slanted, so it's horizontal for me, isn't that a lie?",
    "Effects are still ongoing",
    "Cats like to eat, that's the point.",
    "It's really working.",
    "Tight, clenched feet, back of the legs.",
    "Not recommended.",
    "1.UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, unfortunately this one is too bad",

    "First of all, it's worth noting that Prime's overseas subscriptions are very strong, with the 31st receiving only the 6th.",
    "The shoe color looks much better than the picture, the skin feels good.",
    "The shoe size is slightly larger, 25 feet long, 10.5 wide, 7.5W, the top is slightly loose, but I usually like to wear loose, a mattress with a pair of shoes is fine.",
    "Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not respectful, one shoe soles is damaged, the other shoe has all kinds of scratches and needle eyes, the soles of the shoes and the soles of the shoes are connected by a wrong place, the second is filled!",
    "What a regret!",
    "I bought the 280 for the price of the Athenaeum, which is a good deal, but the reviews are even cheaper.",
    "Now let's talk about shoes, the advantages: the shoes are light, the running is comfortable, and the feet are more comfortable, they don't get loose.",
    "The price is high, but the disadvantages are obvious: I usually wear a 40 shoe, this time I bought a 40.5, and the distance to the front of the shoe is about 1 thumb, but this doesn't affect anything.",
    "The shoes are very tight, although the front is still a distance away, but it feels tight.",
    "There's also the fact that the shoes may not be as well ventilated, and now the feet feel hot.",
    "Pressure on the back of the foot",
    "First of all, the shoes work well, it's worth the price.",
    "My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, amazon's love shoes have also bought a few pairs, never appeared unsuitable feet, but this pair I refer to the review, buy the big one uk7, on the feet behind because the big one yard length is obviously too long, but because the shoe mat is too thick, or the pressure of the back of the foot, plus the hiking shoes are very hard, making it very difficult to guide the feet",
    "If your feet aren't particularly thin, I don't recommend this.",
    "If you have to buy it, you can change the mattress, but the original mattress looks very high-end, it's a pity not to use it.",
    "A perfect shopping spree!",
    "I'm very satisfied, very pleased, Amazon overseas purchases are genuine, no doubt, the quality is also very good, the goods are cheap, the purchase is safe, the after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer attitude is very friendly and friendly, the problem is handled patiently and efficiently, the perfect solution to the concerns of the after-sales service, the delivery is very convenient and stable, the delivery man will take care of the customers, every time reminds to pick up the goods from the courier counter.",

    "I bought it in the winter, less than 200, and I kept it at home for a few months.",
    "When I found out that the bracelet was not connected when I used it in the spring, both equipment explained that they supported each other, and later I found out that it was probably a matter of heart rate, because I couldn't find other equipment.",
    "Call Amazon, let me contact the agency, and the agency will send my equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.",
    "After almost half a month, the goods were returned in the same way as they were sealed, and the courier boxes were the same as the ones I used to send!",
    "No replies and no detection reports!",
    "You have to tell me if it's good or bad!",
    "Call and ask, say so and send it back to say that the equipment is fine, it's fine.",

    "Height: 176 cm, 68 kg, shoulder width: 180 cm, M, lower waist: slightly longer, otherwise worn correctly, I see recommended S, body: so thin? or do you like tight? I think the hat is loose or something good",
    "The size is fine.",

    "The child didn't want to return the goods, he didn't think it was a big deal, but the accessories were such small parts, the child's grandfather ran to several hardware stores nearby and couldn't buy them!",
    "The last one is for Grandpa!",
    "Looks like you won't be able to buy Z's products anymore!",
    "The quality of the toys is poor.",
    "Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the upper bolt is very expensive, the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long I can play, because it's something that is promised to the child, so I don't back down.",
    "Other reviews say the installation is not expensive, so is this the only one I bought that's a problem?",
    "Very common.",
    "Is it my bad luck?",
    "The packaging is old and unworkable; the work is very common; the music is only one and only eight seconds long and then repeated over and over again; the movement is to shake the brain bag and go forward, without any change.",
    "Not worth the price.",
    "If you need it urgently, don't return it.",
    "The quality of the toys is good, so let's talk about the packaging.",
    "Yesterday I received an express, bought by Amazon, the sign says EMS delivery, and finally the cat's express delivery, how many turns did this turn?",
    "The packaging is made of several layers of preservative, and even the plastic foam paper in the packaging is not there, open it and look, all the parts are put in the empty box, and the quality is good, the parts are not damaged, it's much smaller than imagined, because it doesn't have a battery, the hand pushes often off track, the gaps on both sides of the track are too big, the design is unreasonable.",

    "I contacted the manufacturer and asked if the watch was in the warehouse for a check-in time, and they said yes, since there is so much time difference, it must be that the watch is not accurate, simply put, it is a water product, not what I said, it is difficult to hear, look, very obvious quality problems (the numbers are not completely displayed) are sold out, is it garbage?",
    "I contacted the vendors, and the vendors gave a lot of reasons, and complained that they shouldn't have bought their stuff in the first place, this kind of product, this kind of vendor, this kind of after-sales service, and then who would dare to buy stuff on Amazon?",

    "Very satisfied with the watch.",
    "It's definitely genuine, go to the counter and check the goods, the appearance of the watch is beautiful, the workmanship is delicate, the material is sufficient, plus it's an imported mechanical chip, so it's a certain amount, it's the three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches that can't be compared, this is the real price of the goods.",
    "The timing of the watch is very accurate, the error is completely within acceptable limits, the packaging of the watch has a jewelry certification certificate, the 12 words on the dial are real diamonds, this is very suitable to wear, it is also very attractive to give as a gift.",

    "I've just bought a new one, and I'm thinking of canceling my Amazon order right now.",
    "Since the order was placed at midnight, it was not possible to receive the courier in the early hours of the morning, call customer service at 7:00 to cancel the order, customer service has already responded to cancel please wait for text message notification",
    "Okay, I waited patiently, and at noon, I looked at my phone, and the order was still in the status of not shipped, and I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order, and customer service responded that it was OK.",
    "At 3pm, when I looked at the order on my phone, it was still there, and I could only contact the customer service again to clearly inform them that it had been called for the third time, so please cancel the order and inform the seller that you must not send it!",
    "Customer service contacted the seller at my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system, so I had to wait for the system to be familiar and then cancel the order.",
    "But be sure to tell me that the seller already knows, and that it will never be shipped.",

    "After buying it, there was no problem with anything else, that is, when the software was connected, how could it not be connected, my house was a TP router, I checked online and found out that many people had this problem, I did it for more than two hours, various router settings, finally I used 360WIFI as a medium to do it well, during the call to Xiaomi, they did not have any solution to this problem, they let me contact Amazon directly after the sale",
    "Another thing to note is that I saw a user comment online that said that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and the smaller storage capacity cannot be identified, so I hope you will pay attention to this.",
    "It's okay to feel it, it's okay to see it, but the sound quality is bad, the machine has a certain amount of heat, it's been on all the time, it's a little hard to accept the feeling of this amount of heat.",

    "It was from this that I chose Huawei.",
    "I've been buying it for over six months, and it feels good, very good.",
    "The reason I didn't get a full score was because one time I was navigating off-line with it, and I got a misplacement, and I couldn't figure out why, and the other times it was fine.",
    "And it's got a destination on the line, and it's searching, and it's automatically designing the route, and it's leaving the Wi-Fi, and it's very practical to automatically navigate offline, and it doesn't have to run traffic, and it's talking directly to the satellite to do positioning and navigation, which is very good!",
