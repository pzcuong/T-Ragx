    "Silver Colt 25 still leaks gas, when I was changing the valve I had a problem where part of the tank was missing [Buss Bond Q], I sealed the tank and fixed it by using it, if you want to buy this Colt 25, ask someone who can disassemble it, or take pictures while disassembling it, I don't recommend it for people who lack confidence, but if you don't mind breaking it, it might",
    "i thought it would be a pretty good quality for 188 yen",
    "You can use the early return and torque at different times.",
    "I like it to be light and small, and simple without any unnecessary decoration.",
    "There is no gata when you attach the bit, and I thought it was a surprising price for 188 yen.",
    "It depends on the durability.",
    "I don't think it's used that often but I think it's a good tool to have in the box.",
    "I bought it along with the same seller's \"1/4 inch hex socket magnetic quick release driver bit holder 60/100/150 mm\"",
    "No problem here, and it was a lot better than the price.",
    "controller stops working.",
    "The aircraft will move on its own and cannot be controlled.",
    "If you disconnect and reconnect the cable, you can operate it, but after a few minutes, the drone will move in a direction it shouldn't and you won't be able to operate it anymore.",
    "I would not buy this product.",
    "I'll warn you all in advance.",
    "That's a cool product.",
    "It's wired, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.",
    "It's reliable, I've had it for a long time and it's still in good shape.",
    "It can also be used for PC games.",
    "...  Addendum:  I returned it as a defective item within a month and got my Amazon gift card back, so I think that part went well.",
    "So this ups the calculation power?",
    "I think it's for kids who can understand calculations.",
    "Is it not impossible for a child who can't understand calculations?",
    "I can't solve the problem.",
    "Also, when giving tools to parents, I do it by swiping the screen with my finger, but I tried doing it myself and it doesn't get smoother no matter how many times I do it.",
    "I wonder if it's easy for people who are used to DS to get used to it?",
    "I can't help but like the illustrations of manga characters, and I think DS and such are also drawn in to the fun of the screen, but somehow I can't get attached to them.",
    "The way of calculation is also competing with time, for example, how many questions you can answer in how many minutes.",
    "I understand the urgency of tests, but can't you give them time to think and calculate instead of rushing them?",
    "The gong at the end of the game is also something I don't like.",
    "I'm working hard on it, but wouldn't it be better to have a more pleasant sound?",
    "I feel like I lost 6,200 yen.",
    "I can understand that if it\u2019s half the price.",
    "I'm sorry, I translated it into 2 parts.",

    "Nothing has changed from Persona 4.",
    "It feels shorter than the previous one because there's no story.",
    "The song is really cool!",
    "Just listening to it makes me feel better!",
    "The characters of Persona 3 were the first to be HD, so I was moved when I first saw them.",
    "Somehow, Shunpei looks like a handsome man (laugh). Persona 5 is beautiful from the start, so there is no freshness... If you think so, Persona 3 seems more worthwhile.",
    "As a rhythm game, I felt 5 was more fun than 3.",
    "Persona 3 is blue-themed, but it was hard to see when the background was dark.",
    "The main colors are bright reds and yellows, so it is easy to see even if it is against a background.",
    "With all the assist functions, I think even someone who is bad at rhythm games can play it.",
    "Turning on the challenge function for a rhythm game veteran might make a game with a lot of teeth.",
    "The triple pack comes with santolla but it's not just a freebie, it's a proper 4 pack so if you're a fan of persona's music I'd recommend this.",
    "that's too bad.",
    "I bought it because I liked the color of the clock face in the picture, but the actual product has a blue tint and is more like black or charcoal gray.",
    "And it wasn't a double buckle.",
    "I was thinking of buying gold too, but I'm holding off for now. The price is low, so should I give up?",
    "Update: I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to send a replacement after the review was published.",
    "The rest of the process was quick.",
    "I think the response was great, even for a cheaper product.",
    "Four stars for response  Addendum:  After that, I bought gold.",
    "I think the color is almost exactly like the picture and it's very pretty.",
    "But it's clear that the buckle is not double-locked, unlike the explanation picture.",
    "That's the only thing that's unfortunate.",
    "It gets heavy in the evening.",
    "I used it on a free SIM iPhone 7s.",
    "I didn't know what to do when I arrived in Korea and pointed to the SIM card, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Incheon Airport and she showed me (Settings > Mobile Communication > Communication Options, turn on data roaming).",
    "The pitch that came with the product didn't seem to have much to do with it...?",
    "The problem is that the area around Gimpo Airport has poor reception, so I couldn't get 3G for a long time.",
    "When I go to the city, it becomes 4G.",
    "Sometimes the connection gets really heavy in the evening and night, and I think it might have reached up to 1GB per day at its peak.",
    "it's better than i thought.",
    "I used SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, switched to sim free and used it on Ymobile, because Z4 was not popular, I was looking for a used Xperia, but I bought this phone that can be used with a new SIM card.",
    "I was worried that I wouldn't be able to use it properly since I was using Mobile Suica, but there were no problems at all.",
    "The size, weight, and silver color make it look like an iPhone 6 to me.",
    "No game, so processing speed is the same as Z4, just a little faster in my opinion  Review said fingerprint recognition was slow, but it takes a little time to recognize, so face recognition is faster, so I use this.",
    "I thought it was great, just like the iPhone, and I was satisfied with my purchase, even though I upgraded to Android version 9.",
    "I think it's a little too big, I would like it to be smaller, it doesn't have a strap hole, *I can use it with a case that has a strap hole, I haven't tested it for waterproofness, it's a little heavy, I haven't used it much but I'm satisfied, I recommend it."
