    "Normally, GNU C++ allows a conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.",
    "-fexternal-templates generates smaller code for template declarations (template declarations) (only in C++) by generating a copy of each template function only where they are defined.",
    "To use this option successfully, you must mark all files that use templates with `#pragma implementation` (definition) or `#pragma interface` (declaration).",
    "When compiling with -fexternal-templates, all template instantiations are external types. You must ensure that the required instantiations appear in the implementation file.",

    "If no ` signed' or ` unsigned' qualifier is specified, these options define a signed or unsigned bitfield.",
    "By default, bitfields are signed, because they inherit the basic integer type, such as int, which is signed, but if the -traditional option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.",
    "-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment and treats them specially.",
    "This is for compatibility with some old programs that thought it was a very bad idea to make string constants writable; the `-traditional' option also has the same effect.",

    "COVID-19 Impact on the Drug Market",
    "its effects may be similar to the 2008 economic crisis",
    "The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into uncharted territory.",
    "In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health services, brought them to the brink of collapse and caused severe disruptions to the global economy as governments have imposed restrictions.",
    "The impact of the pandemic on the drug market is unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be profound.",
    "Some producers may be forced to find new ways to produce drugs as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and basic chemicals.",
    "Traffickers, unable to travel, may have to find new routes and methods.",
    "Patterns of drug use and supply may change, and governments' ability to respond may be hampered.",
    "The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but there are lessons to be learned from previous crises.",
    "After the 2008 economic crisis, some users started looking for cheaper synthetic substances and moved to injecting drugs.",
    "At the same time, governments have cut funding for drug-related programs.",
    "If governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way, prevention interventions and services to address drug use and related risk behaviours, as well as treatment services, may be heavily impacted.",
    "Furthermore, the priority of interdiction and international cooperation may be reduced, making it easier for traffickers to operate.",
    "Some countries have seen large amounts of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and it is expected that these countries will be most directly affected by drug trafficking.",
    "Couriers have been known to carry large quantities of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their hand luggage or concealed in their checked-in baggage. With almost all countries now imposing restrictions on air travel, the supply of drugs via commercial air travel may be completely disrupted.",
    "While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, activities involving the use of the dark web and mail order may increase.",
    "In the long term , economic recession and associated measures may disrupt the drug market .",
    "With rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to turn to drugs in harmful ways, become addicted, and turn to illegal activities related to production or transportation of drugs.",
    "Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of the situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to bolster their ranks.",
    "With a diminished government response, these changes may take root quickly and become the new reality for many communities.",
    "Expansion and complexity",
    "Market growth",
    "Population growth patterns partially explain the reasons for market expansion",
    "The global drug problem has been growing, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the world population.",
    "In 2009, an estimated 210 million people were drug users, representing 4.8% of the global population aged 15\u201364, and in 2018, an estimated 269 million people were drug users, representing 5.3% of this population.",
    "In the past 20 years, the growth rate of drug abuse in developing countries has far exceeded that of developed countries.",
    "This to some extent reflects the difference in overall population growth, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of young populations in developing countries.",
    "The proportion of teenagers and young adults among drug users is the largest.",
    "From 2000 to 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.",
    "1. Urbanization is a driving force for the current and future drug market.",
    "In both developed and developing countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.",
    "The overall increase in drug use is due to the large-scale migration of the population from rural areas to cities. At present, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.",
    "Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in countries with more pronounced urbanization trends.",
    "Increases in wealth are associated with increased drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide, and drug use is more widespread in developed countries.",
    "Cocaine and the like are more strongly associated with wealthier parts of the world.",
    "Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the more affluent social strata.",
    "However, the rate of transition to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socio-economic status.",
    "Data from a few countries show that harmful patterns of drug use are associated with disease and low income.",
    "These patterns are less common in more affluent social strata .",
    "The economic constraints of the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risk of the most vulnerable, including drug users.",

    "When individual fitness centers have some of their stores encountering operational problems and temporarily closing, consumers can be calm and wait for the problem to be resolved. Why do some members have the first reaction of \"something is wrong\"?",
    "Behind the fitness club member rights protection storm, there is a deep-seated problem of trust crisis in the industry.",
    "In China, traditional gyms generally adopt the prepaid model, and \"earning money when users don't come\" is the bottom line of their development.",

A Luzhou apartment claimed to offer \u201cdifference payment\u201d and that the discounts on other properties were greater than the previous discounts. The developer was willing to exchange",

    "Mr Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this was actually a \"price guarantee\", which was to make the buyers feel at ease to buy, and not to worry that the developer would lower the price to promote sales, \"Now I'm afraid that after buying it, it will be lowered, and there will be a lot of trouble at the sales office, and if there is no trouble, it is indeed a heartache.\"",

    "Among them, vegetable prices rose 28.25%, setting a new high in 17 months.",
    "Cao Zhihong, a special commissioner of the Taiwan \"Bureau of Statistics\", admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed greater than expected. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, and the inflationary pressure still exists and is still at a high level.",
    "Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, according to the reports of United Daily News and \"Yahoo Finance\" and other domestic media, experts are pessimistic.",
    "Professor Wu Daren of the Economics Department of Central University in Taiwan analyzed that the export downturn may cause cash flow problems for exporters in the manufacturing industry, and the risk of debt default will increase.",
    "At the same time, the reduction in orders led to the reduction of labor costs for enterprises, which affected the labor market and family economy, and in turn affected the consumption ability.",
    "According to Qiu Dashan, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the inflation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved, and the demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that the export decline in Taiwan will continue into the first half of the year.",

    "A: On February 3, the US Labor Department released the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with a net increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the hourly wage increased by 4.4% year-on-year and",
    "From the total, this data has many one-time and technical factors that interfere, such as the adjustment of the behavior of survey and statistics, the update of seasonal factors, and the possible adjustment in the future (the non-agricultural employment increased from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and the non-agricultural employment is not as strong as the data shows.",
    "From the structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; the new employment in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education, health care, etc. has risen sharply, and the data shows that the labor force shortage in the service industry still exists.",
    "Combined with the strong rebound of service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor shortage data, as well as the robust consumption credit data, we judge that the US service industry will experience a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.",
    "We believe that the tight supply and demand in the US labor market cannot be improved without a recession.",
    "Currently, the U.S. labor market has more than 5 million supply gaps, and the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-pandemic high.",
    "In addition, due to the strong savings and consumption credit of American residents, the strong demand for consumption will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the labor market.",
    "The continued tightness of the supply and demand in the US labor market will be the bottom line of the US economy in 2023.",
    "With the interest rate hike almost coming to an end and the inflation expectation fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.",
    "Before the release of the data, the U.S. foreign exchange market was overly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.",
    "With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve has maintained the balance of keeping the market inflation expectations weak while shortening the interest rate hike steps, but the market has ignored the Fed's hawkish statements and not only expected the early cessation of interest rate hikes, but also expected two rate cuts at the end of the year.",
    "In the context of tight labor market supply and demand and the uncertainty of the impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the extreme expectations and trading congestion of the market may cause some damage to the market.",
    "Despite this, the persistent slowdown in wage growth is only likely to underpin future inflation data as M2 year-on-year growth turns negative and various CPI components lead indicators to gradually improve, with U.S. CPI data having turned to a fast-falling phase since October, and the current market expectations are difficult to refute, and the market may enter a new round of bargaining after the next inflation data is released.",

    "It's really hard to believe, the fact that the clothing was wrong is not my problem, as a consumer I demand to get the product I should have, and I didn't ask for anything outrageous, Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.",
    "This is my first review, I hope it's not my last.",
    "Unbelievable sleeves",
    "It says it is leather, and it is a bit stiff, but on closer inspection there are lots of small cracks in it, so I am not sure if it is real leather, and the sleeves on this shirt are just bizarre, normally the cuffs on a shirt are a little longer than the shirt itself, but only by 1-2cm, but this shirt has sleeves that are 5cm longer than the shirt itself, so your hands just hang down past",
    "Buying clothes is easy, returning them is easy.",
    "But when will I get my money back?",
    "The clothes are well made, but the size is small, so I can only return it, but after returning the goods, it has been more than a week, and I have not received the refund?",
    "And to make it worse, you have to contact the dodgy Full Peak Courier to get your money back, this is the worst shopping experience I have had buying from Amazon!",
    "But the shop is still good, actively cooperate to urge the courier to refund in time, but this full peak courier is really doing very angry, refund about half a month, this partner is dragging the Amazon behind, efficiency is low, no service consciousness!",
    "What cities are the best for a child that young?",
    "Killed in 0.99 seconds.",
    "The workmanship, color, and feel of the pants are all good, the softness/thickness is just right, and there is no smell of oil.",
    "Unfortunately, the cut is for slim people, more suitable for young people.",

    "Also, stick-on clothes are not comfortable.",
    "Good. The color is not very bright.",
    "I just bought it and it went up by more than 200, what's going on.",
    "First time using Amazon, first time using their partnered delivery service, DHL, first time delivery not at home, I proactively arranged delivery twice with the delivery man, but he didn't deliver, then he refunded me, this delivery man has no integrity, I strongly recommend not to use DHL.",
    "They also returned a body t-shirt to me, and the price increased by more than 100 yuan after re-taking photos.",
    "Amazon self-operated should not have such products",
    "I bought it when it was on sale, the price is not low, and the reviews are also very good products.",
    "When I received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product has a large area of wear, and there is wear in other places. It is either a second-hand product or a used product. I will post a picture later.",
    "I applied for a return, the factory said that the damage was caused by transportation, isn't that nonsense?",
    "How can the product be damaged inside?",
    "There are only two possibilities, either it is a second hand or a faulty product, or I have intentionally damaged the product and returned it.",
    "Objectively, I don't have any evidence to prove that I didn't damage the product, but based on my record of shopping on Amazon, I think that products like this should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products, because customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them, and we win, customer wins, we win, customer's win is the manufacturer's win, I hope we can all work together to improve, thank you",
    "I used this product for less than a year and two E2s appeared, I don't know how to handle it?",
    "I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the receiver on the right side started to show red E2 frequently, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, right? This does not seem to match the statement on Amazon website that the transmitter module can work continuously for 7 years. I can't find any after-sales service on Amazon website, so I don't know what to",
    "Is it well organized?)",
    "First purchase is bad.",
    "It doesn't feel like new.",
    "The label on the box is torn, and the label on the device is also broken.",
    "And it always freezes.",
    "It was fine after I changed it.",
    "The replacement was quick, but it was a bit blurry at night, and the field of view was not very wide, but it was enough for ordinary home use.",
    "The only downside is that there is no card, which I bought myself, and the other is that I bought a phone from Amazon before.",
    "There will be a sticker on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, but there was no such sticker this time, and there was a sticker similar to the one on the packaging when I bought the phone, which can be pasted on the warranty card, but there was no such sticker this time.",
    "I don't know if it's because the things are cheap and there is no one, I am very confused.",
    "Waiting for the supplier to reply",
    "The packaging has no mark, I called the supplier and said that there is no mark, and if there is any doubt, I can send the corner of the material to Johnson & Johnson for authentication, and leave the license plate number and phone number, and promise to send a text message to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson official website for the warranty card, but I have not received the text message yet?",
    "I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.",
    "AM: Second edition, OK.",
    "Amazon self-operated products are still very reassuring.",
    "The mechanic said the oil was clear and bright, and it was indeed good oil.",
    "This is the second time they've been bought.",
    "So we were pretty reassured by this.",
    "The delivery was fast, the packaging was not picky, and the oil was used, and the engine sound was obviously reduced.",

    "But this time, the L-sized diapers came in a box with two separate packs, and the paper felt a bit flimsy when opened, and there was a clear difference from the imported Pampers, but it was still okay for the baby, and there were no signs of leaks or rashes.",
    "But when the second package was used, the baby's inner thighs immediately showed red rashes, which have not faded away until now.",

    "Anyway, I think this thing is really good.",
    "Second, I ordered on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days, which is about half a month. The delivery service attitude of Amazon is also very good.",
    "Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday, I ordered on Friday and the price dropped by nearly 12 yuan after waiting for two days, which is about 170 yuan (including shipping fees and so on) that I paid, and it feels like they are raising the price for the promotion.",
    "The customer service said something about price fluctuations, but I paid attention for more than 10 days, and the price was just like this, and the fluctuations were not big.",
    "The price is reasonable, made in China, with Chinese tags, and with small grains, I will definitely buy again!",
    "The granules in the ointment are just right, and the feeling is refreshing. After use, the teeth and gums are smooth, and it is much stronger than some second-hand products. They say it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels, and it is not clear where they are wholesale.",
    "In the future, I will only buy from Amazon, and will not go to second-hand stores.",
    "I have a suggestion, sometimes the single on the Amazon app can't be burned, I hope to improve some applications, it will be better and better!",
    "Pingxiang has been getting worse in recent years, and there is no service quality to speak of!",
    "JD does not care about customer needs. When ordering, the delivery time is 19:00-22:00.",
    "Because there is an old person who can't sleep on a sofa bed at home, so it can only be convenient to receive it at night.",
    "The result was that they delivered at 12pm in the middle of the day without any prior phone call.",
    "If the delivery time is what the courier wants to deliver at any time, why bother to make customers choose a time?",
    "If you can\u2019t guarantee the service, then don\u2019t do e-commerce!",

    "I think it's acceptable, first of all because it's cheap, and because it's divided into two volumes, which makes it easier to browse as a paperback; secondly, because it's different from the Michelangelo Complete Edition, which is dominated by paintings, while the Da Vinci black and white sketchbook is the main focus, for budget-conscious readers who are not art professionals, this version has the highest price/performance ratio for appreciating",

They replied \"yes\", so why is the time difference so much, which means the watch is not accurate, simply put, it is a water product, I am not saying it is difficult to hear, look, it is clearly a quality problem (the number display is incomplete), and all of them are sold, is it garbage.",
    "I contacted the seller, the seller said a lot of reasons, and blamed me for buying their things, such products, such sellers, such after-sales service, in the future, who will dare to buy things on Amazon.",

    "The worst shopping experience in history",
    "In the evening of September 23, my wife dropped her phone, and I was suddenly inspired to order a 8p from Amazon Malaysia. It was in stock, but not self-operated and without any additional fees (I was secretly happy), because it was not self-operated, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the latest expected delivery date was September 27.",
    "My wife couldn\u2019t use her phone, so she was suffering. The next morning, she called me at 6:30 and asked me to think of a solution. After looking at Jingdong, I found that the 256G version was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.",
    "I bought a new one, and I wanted to cancel the order from Amazon right away.",
    "Because the order was placed at night, it was impossible to receive the express delivery in the middle of the night, so at 7:30 in the morning, I called the customer service to request the cancellation of the order, and the customer service replied that the order had been canceled and was waiting for the SMS notification.",
    "OK, I will wait patiently. In the afternoon, I took out my phone and found that the order was still in the status of not shipped. I immediately contacted the customer service to request the cancellation of the order, and the customer service replied that the operation was OK.",

    "The order is still in the status of delivery refusal, and is preparing to be sent again!",
    "Amazon should have followed up, shouldn't they?",

    "Every time I see this Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain comes back and fills me up, I've never thrown away a phone that cost more than 2000 yuan, but I didn't hesitate to buy it for her, no matter how good a person is, one day when she falls out of love, all the promises will be gone.",
