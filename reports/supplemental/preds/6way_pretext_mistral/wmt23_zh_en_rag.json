    "The changes brought by the new coronavirus are unprecedented, but we can still learn some lessons from previous crises.",
    "after the 2008 economic crisis , some addicts began to seek cheaper synthetic substances and shifted to injecting drugs .",
    "Meanwhile, governments have cut funding for drug-related programs.",
    "if governments respond to the current recession in the same way , prevention efforts and services for substance abuse and related risk behaviors may be severely affected .",
    "in addition , the priority given to interdiction and international cooperation may be reduced , making it easier for traffickers to operate .",
    "Some countries have large quantities of drugs smuggled through commercial flights , and it is expected that the direct impact of these countries' drug trafficking activities will be the greatest.",
    "couriers carry methamphetamine and other drugs in their carry-on bags or conceal them in their luggage . Sometimes the quantities are large . With almost all countries imposing restrictions on air travel , the commercial supply of drugs through air travel may be completely disrupted .",
    "While international mail supply chains have been disrupted , activities that use the dark web and parcel delivery to sell goods may increase .",
    "in the long term , economic recession and related measures may disrupt the drug market .",
    "because of the rising unemployment rate and lack of opportunities , the poor and vulnerable populations are more likely to use drugs in a harmful way , become addicted to drugs , and engage in illegal activities related to drugs , whether it is production or transportation .",
    "Drug trafficking organizations may exploit this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to bolster their ranks.",

    "in the past 20 years , the growth rate of drug addiction in developing countries has been much faster than that in developed countries .",
    "this reflects to some extent the differences in overall population growth over this period , with developed countries growing at 7 % , developing countries at 28 % , but also the fact that the population growth of young people in developing countries is faster .",
    "adolescents and young adults are the most common demographic among drug users .",
    "Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group grew by 16% in developing countries, while it decreased by 10% in developed countries.",
    "1. urbanization is a driving force for the current and future drug markets",
    "In both developed and developing countries, the prevalence of drug addiction is higher in urban areas than in rural areas.",
    "The overall increase in drug addiction is partly due to the massive population flow from rural areas to cities. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.",
    "urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market , especially in developing countries where urbanization is more pronounced .",
    "an increase in wealth is associated with an increase in drug use , but the burden of disease is borne most heavily by the poorest people worldwide , and drug use is more common in developed than in developing countries .",
    "Cocaine and other drugs are more closely linked to wealthier parts of the world.",
    "Similarly , within countries , drug use is more common among the socially affluent .",
    "but the rate of addiction is high among people with lower socioeconomic status .",
    "data from a few countries suggest a link between harmful smoking patterns and disease in low @-@ income populations .",
    "these patterns seem less common in more affluent strata .",
    "The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks faced by the most vulnerable populations, including drug users.",
    "For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have historically been linked to increases in drug use, but this pandemic has already forced millions of people around the world to be unemployed.",
    "COVID-19 may further expand the drug market, as the pandemic may lead to more farmers to engage in illicit cultivation, or due to the weakening control of the regulatory authorities, or due to more people being forced to engage in illegal activities in the face of economic crisis.",
    "The related measures of COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land transportation, while sea transportation may have increased, as the risk of interception is low and the number of smuggling is more than that of air and land.",
    "Recently, there have been reports that cocaine is being smuggled directly from South America to Europe by sea.",
    "complexity is enhanced",
    "the availability of non @-@ controlled substances is stable , but new types of opioids with potential for harm are proliferating , and the drug market is becoming more complex .",
    "in addition to the hundreds of synthetic drugs that have been added to the list of plant-based drugs such as marijuana , cocaine , and heroin , many of these drugs are not subject to international control.",
    "The domestic market of member countries has about 500 new active substances every year.",
    "currently , most of these are stimulants , followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a few opioids .",
    "although the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized , the proportions have changed .",
    "Of the 150 new psychoactive substances (NPS) identified in 2014, only 2% were opioid-like, but by 2018, this had risen to 9%.",
    "among the new psychoactive substances , many are fentanyl analogs , and their effects and risks have been documented , with overdose deaths in North America and elsewhere , albeit to a lesser degree .",
    "in North America , fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs ( including cocaine and methamphetamine ) , as well as for the production of counterfeit opioid analgesics .",
    "some evidence suggests that injection of new psychoactive substances is also occurring in Europe : a study of residual syringes in six European cities found that many were contaminated with substances that produce a stimulant effect >",
    "the use of new psychoactive substances may become increasingly entrenched in disadvantaged communities",
    "a single type of new psychoactive substance has never formed a large market .",
    "but evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among homeless and prison populations.",
    "twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons , with synthetic cannabinoids being the main challenge in most countries .",
    "The control of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate, and many chemicals used to synthesize phenylacetone, methamphetamine, amphetamine and \u201cecstasy\u201d have been placed under international control.",

    "Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.",
    "However, the seizure amount in the first half of 2019 was 1657 kg - a significant increase compared to the previous year.",

    "Canada, Uruguay and the United States' 11 jurisdictions allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.",
    "in most jurisdictions , cannabis use has increased since legalization , although similar trends have been observed in jurisdictions that have not legalized nonmedical use .",
    "In the two states where marijuana was first legalized, Colorado and Washington, the number of adults using marijuana for nonmedical purposes has increased, especially in the past month and among those who use daily or almost daily, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.",
    "All indicators show that marijuana use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, and last month it almost doubled.",
    "the increase was primarily due to frequent and regular use .",
    "Canadian short-term data also shows that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage increased.",
    "However , 40 % of cannabis users still obtained some products illegally in 2019 .",
    "Is the decline in global cannabis herb seizures due to cannabis legalization?",
    "In 2018, global seizures of cannabis herb reached the lowest level in the past 20 years, because seizures in North America dropped by 84% over the past 10 years.",
    "in contrast , seizures in other parts of the world nearly doubled during the same period . The seizure pattern suggests that policies intended to liberalize the marijuana market are having a key impact .",
    "regulation of new psychoactive substances ( NPS ) appears to have had a dampening effect on the availability of NPS within the country , but the effectiveness of NPS regulation remains difficult to assess .",
    "some countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances have shown different rates of use .",
    "in some countries , the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after national legislation .",
    "disadvantaged populations are disproportionately harmed by both legal and illicit opioid markets and are more likely to receive prescription opioids for pain management and palliative care in high @-@ income countries .",
    "in 2018 , more than 90 % of all medical consumption of opioids were in high @-@ income countries .",
    "About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in the Pacific.",
    "These countries account for about 12 percent of the world's population.",
    "it is estimated that 88 % of the world 's population live in low - and middle - income countries , but they account for less than 10 % of global consumption of opioid analgesics .",
    "barriers to obtaining prescription opioids are multifactorial , including legislation , culture , health system factors , and prescribing practices .",
    "The risk of addiction is higher for the poor. In 2018, about 35.6 million people were addicted to drugs.",
    "poverty , limited education , and social marginalization may increase the risk of addiction and worsen its consequences . evidence from high @-@ income countries suggests that these factors can also influence addiction risk through personal social @-@ economic trajectories , not just at a single point in time .",
    "substance abuse disorders exacerbate social and economic disadvantage , further increasing the risks of unemployment , poverty , and homelessness , and thus perpetuating the vicious cycle of disadvantage .",
    "women , ethnic minorities , migrants , diverse sexual orientations , populations displaced by armed conflict or disaster , and rural populations are also disproportionately affected by opioid use disorders or have difficulty accessing treatment services .",

    "the increase in life @-@ years lost from related comorbidities associated with untreated hepatitis C in injection @-@ drug users was particularly high , at 40 % .",
    "the relationship between drug use and violence is complex and difficult to determine the causal relationship between all the factors of substance use and violence .",
    "global data suggest that drunkenness may be an important factor in homicide .",
    "but in violent events , alcohol seems to have a greater effect than drugs .",
    "although drug use may be associated with criminality , in some cases this association can be partially attributed to multiple mediating factors , such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity that are influenced by personal risk , family environment , and peers .",
    "the connections between drug trafficking and violence are multifaceted .",
    "if there is a well-established criminal structure , including large-scale organized drug trafficking , such activities may be carried out peacefully .",
    "in the short term , the level and degree of violence are more likely to be determined by the nature of the change that is destabilizing the power balance between organized criminal groups , such as changes in the size of the illicit market , the death or incarceration of prominent criminals , or law enforcement actions that make one group weaker than another .",
    "the latest trends",
    "Marijuana is the most commonly used substance , and opioids are the most harmful .",
    "An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most widely used drug globally.",
    "In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.",
    "but the associated harms of opioids are often overlooked because of their relatively small user base .",
    "in 2017 , an estimated 167,000 deaths were attributed to drug use disorders , with 66 % of those deaths due to these substances and 50 % of the 210 million years of life lost due to premature death or disability resulting from conditions believed to be caused by drug use .",
    "Synthetic Opioid Misuse Worsens Public Health Crisis",
    "in West Africa , Central Africa , and North Africa , the synthetic opioid crisis is driven by tramadol ; in North America , it is fentanyl . These regions have little in common economically , demographically , or in terms of general drug use patterns , but they are both struggling to combat a crisis fueled by the availability and low cost of substances that are easy to obtain and produce .",
    "in North America , the use of synthetic opioids , such as fentanyl , has led to a surge in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years .",
    "In 2018, fentanyl was involved in nearly two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths recorded in the United States.",
    "Canada also reported similar results, with lower numbers.",
    "one reason that fentanyl is involved in so many overdose deaths is that the potency of the drug on the illicit market is unpredictable .",
    "the market for tramadol for nonmedical use has grown substantially in West Africa , Central Africa , and North Africa .",
    "in that region , tramadol use by patients with pain is becoming more common .",
    "In 2017 , the global seizure of tramadol increased significantly and reached a peak of more than 125 tons.",
    "But in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate tramadol, global seizures fell to 3,200 tons.",
    "the drivers of these crises are the simplicity of manufacture and the low cost of production , as well as the lack of international oversight of tramadol and many fentanyl analogs or their precursors .",
    "the worsening of these crises is due to the fact that these substances are available on both the legal and illegal markets , making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse .",
    "the use of stimulants is on the rise .",
    "the stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine , both of which are increasing in use in their main markets .",
    "In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, because cocaine is popular in North America and Western Europe.",
    "Approximately 27 million people used methamphetamine that year , with methamphetamine hydrochloride being the most commonly used methamphetamine in Southeast Asia and North America .",
    "according to most indicators , methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for the past 2 decades .",
    "in some markets , cocaine and methamphetamine coexist , sometimes substituting for each other , so that as the use of one drug rises , the use of the other falls , sometimes both drugs are used concurrently , with one drug being used to offset the other .",
    "COVID-19 increases the risk of injection drug users",
    "An estimated 11.3 million people inject drugs in 2018, and approximately 10 % of the global HIV infections are attributed to injecting drug use.",
    "More than 100,000 people who inject drugs have HIV, and 5.5 million have Hepatitis C.",
    "In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died of drug addiction, half of whom died of liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the hepatitis C in intravenous drug users is still untreated.",
    "shortages of opioids caused by COVID @-@ 19 restrictions may lead to users substituting with alcohol or benzodiazepines , which are easier to obtain , or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs .",
    "with some users switching to injecting or injecting more frequently , there may be more harmful use .",

    "This book is shallow, it can be said that it is just an introductory course, which can help everyone quickly understand the overall situation of Internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still need to find the clues yourself and dig deeper.",
    "And the book was published earlier, so it didn't mention the later Alipay WeChat supplementary war to cultivate user habits, and the third-party payment market share mentioned in the book is probably much smaller than it is now.",
    "Nowadays, many people go out to eat just by bringing their mobile phones, and merchants also gave up UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.",
    "However, I would like to thank the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has had many years of financial observation experience, and is familiar with the financial development history of both China and the world, so he can write such clear and easy-to-understand content.",
    "It's easy to write high-level stuff, the hard part is writing it in plain English.",
    "I love you, and I want you to know it!",
    "The first factor in determining a person's job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether they are valued and recognized in their work.",
    "According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after the basic needs of survival are met, the most urgent need is for psychological needs to be met - the need to be understood, approved, and recognized.",
    "In fact, for the Chinese, most of them are \"love you in the heart of the throat is difficult to open\", even if they love, thank and praise are all in the heart, but will not say it.",
    "In this book, the author explains the five love languages: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, gifts, and physical touch.",
    "I don't think it's important that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use them spontaneously and sincerely to appreciate the people in your life, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.",
    "The closer the people in our lives, the more we need to praise and thank them, and that makes our lives better.",
    "If you learn to praise and reward, enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the turnover rate.",
    "Thank you for translating for us and bringing us the exciting ideas and the world from abroad.",
    "Because of the background of Chinese and Western culture, there are differences in language, and if there is an opportunity to see the original version, it will be more beneficial.",

    "Suspected counterfeit, please Amazon to review strictly.",
    "The quality is terrible, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it is even worse than the roadside stalls, there is no weight, no barcode, even 10 bags are loose, it is a feature of unqualified products; it is the worst shopping experience of Amazon, I have applied for a refund; it is a quality problem; I suggest merchants to open their eyes and refuse to buy low-quality goods; supplement: I also bought a brand,",

    "1. No charging indicator, even the most basic power indicator is saved, customers who buy 300 yuan products are discarded by SONY, and there is no respect.",
    "There is a strong odor when charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, the smell of burning plastic is very strong.",
    "I tried it for one day in the office and the whole house smells like plastic.",
    "Compared with the Philips I used before at the same price, although there is an additional blade, but the quality of this product is really sorry for the consumer.",
    "small packaging",
    "I received the express and saw the word \"electronic commerce version\" written on the top, so I knew I had fallen into a hole again. It is much cheaper than buying it at the supermarket. I guess it is M, and the packaging of the product is different from the picture on the website, so it is the new version.",
    "The three stars are for being careless and not noticing the product specifications, I don't mind selling the M version of the e-commerce, but what do you mean by the wrong version?",
    "The online shopping platform is very convenient, but sometimes I still go to the supermarket to buy things.",
    "Just the sauce.",

    "it's the real deal, and it's packaged well.",
    "The packaging is complete, and there is a gas bag inside, but there are no reviews online except for the product of the bald head.",
    "The plastic wrap on the outside of the bottle was as described in the picture and the delivery was very quick, arrived the next day after the picture was taken.",

    "The operating system is pretty standard.",
    "After a while, the overall picture is OK, I don't feel any difference, but this system makes you feel complicated, the boot time is obviously slower, the settings are not good, the software that comes with it is not worth mentioning, and the response speed is even more ordinary, it is not a magnitude compared to my colleagues.",
    "The review says it is very humanized design, but I can't find where it is humanized, the position of the common up and down, left and right, and return key is really not good.",

    "Amazon has accumulated a lot of unrated orders, so I use a copy of a sentence as the review content.",
    "If I were to rate it based on that, I would give it at least 85 out of 100.",
    "I would never resort to copying and pasting reviews for a product that is subpar, as other consumers would use that as a reference and the seller would improve the quality of the product.",

    "This cheap cable should have met the HDMI certification standard, but I have compared it with the domestic Akihabara dog shit (the price is twice as high), the cable is thick and sturdy, and it is relatively soft, and there is no noise when transmitting 7 meters, and I will recognize the low-priced cable in the future!",
    "The items are fine, but Amazon's customer service is really bad compared to other sites.",
    "I ordered something by mistake and then realized it, but I couldn't cancel the order, the website's online customer service always shows the wrong link, I couldn't contact them.",
    "After the delivery, the delivery man called me and I said I didn't want it, but I couldn't cancel the order, so he took it back and said I should sign for it first and then apply for a refund.",
    "When I applied for a refund, I was told that food items cannot be returned once they have been received, and I couldn't get through to Amazon's customer service on the phone, and they also said the same thing, that they couldn't be returned once they had been received.",
    "I have bought things that cannot be returned from JD and Suning before, including milk and disposable diapers, and contacted the customer service to return them, and JD's disposable diapers smelled too much after opening, and the customer service also returned it to me, but you can't do it on Amazon.",
    "The rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service and see how they handle it?",

    "Don't waste your money",
    "First, I was looking forward to buying it, I thought that the Lecce brand should not be bad, after receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay, the taste was not bad, but one box was basically soft, it was not obvious from the outside, but the texture was not good, it had no taste when you touched it and put it in your mouth, it was bland and tasteless, the fruit circle was dark yellow when it was bitten, which was bad,",
    "Save yourself some time by buying clever.",
    "Where is the anti-counterfeiting mark of the product",
    "The bottle bottom corner is very deep, it must have been hit hard, it feels a bit wobbly from the outside packaging, it's just too simple for food packaging, and it's imported, I don't see any obvious anti-counterfeiting markings, it's very easy to open, the key is that the inner layer of honey directly comes out, there's almost no stickiness when opening, are all foreign products like this?",
    "I don't understand it.",

    "Delivery services need to improve",
    "I bought 5 delivery vouchers, when I went to pick them up, I reserved 3 times, but only 2 were sent, after many discussions, it was confirmed that it was a mistake, and they promised to send the remaining one; the second time I reserved, I happened to be on a holiday, and the website and WeChat did not remind me to reserve on a working day, which caused unnecessary anxiety, and I suggest that this be improved in the future.",
    "a good shopping experience.",
    "The product is highly praised!",
    "I still prefer to buy things from Amazon's own brand, now that it's so convenient to buy things overseas, the time it takes for things to be delivered from overseas to China is only a few days longer than it takes for things to be delivered from within China, and Amazon's ability to clear customs is still very strong, it's much faster than transshipment, so I buy a lot of things overseas.",
    "I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better, many things are made in China, but it is cheaper to buy them abroad and come back, I hope to improve.",

    "If I just encountered one of these, I would have been fine, but I bought several of these and when I called Amazon customer service, they said I could return it, but I would have to pay for shipping, and then they would return the shipping cost to me in the form of a gift card.",
    "I asked, I pay cash for shipping, you give me a gift card, that means I have to buy a gift card myself, and then I have to send the product to the German warehouse, that's not just buying a product!",
    "I have been talking to customer service all the time, who is responsible for this problem, but the customer service did not say it is their responsibility, they did not dare to take any responsibility, what kind of after-sales service is there without any guarantee? One word: admit it! But I guess Amazon will not give me a chance to publish this review, they will just delete it!",
    "The quality is good, 5 stars, but the logistics are bad.",
    "1. The quality is good, it's a kill, the price is average, and it's worth it.",

    "4. If Amazon had marked the expected delivery date as February 7th, I would have been very happy.",
